class: inverse 

In previous weeks, we explored the concepts of poverty, vulnerability to poverty, and the importance of evaluating social policies and programs.

--

This week, we will focus on social assistance programs—a critical tool used globally to reduce poverty and support vulnerable populations.

--

We will learn about:

--

- Different types of social assistance programs 

--

- How these programs are designed and targeted

--

- What the impacts of those programs are

--

- The role of social assistance in broader development and social protection frameworks

--

This foundation will prepare us to critically discuss real-world case studies and policy implications.

Based on this classification, we can define four types of social assistance programs.

&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# The chronic poor

**Income generation programs**: to provide income-generation opportunities (safety ropes) for the poor to escape poverty. 

--

- asset formation, e.g., human capital accumulation through education.

- creation of employment &amp; investment opportunities.

- “smart” input subsidies that lead to more efficient use of resources.
  
--

**Social assistance programs**: ("non-contributory") 

--

- *Equity programs*: reduce chronic poverty via transfers and achieve social inclusion, improving equity for the chronic poor.

  - e.g., cash transfers, school feeding, food subsidies, and public health services.
  
--

- *Risk-coping programs*: protect income/consumption from negative shocks and/or to protect or replace their assets.

  - The objective is to help the poor stay out of destitution and poverty traps. 
  
  - e.g., index-based weather insurance, emergency stay-in-school and animal feeding programs to protect households from asset decapitalization when hit by a shock.
  
  
---

# The vulnerable non-poor

These social assistance programs are known as "contributory social-insurance programs."

--

The objective is to reduce vulnerability to poverty of the currently non-poor by *increasing resilience*.

--

These programs are contributory in the sense that access to benefits is restricted to people who have made at least some payments to the program, even if only a fraction of cost. 

--

- e.g., unemployment/disability insurance


--

We also have **Twin-track programs**:

--

- These aim to both *reduce immediate chronic poverty through transfers and wages* (Type 2), and *enhance future income generating capacity through investment in productive assets* (Type 1).

--

  - e.g., conditional cash transfers, productive safety nets, community-driven development (CDD), guaranteed employment programs, public works programs.
  
  
---

# Some notes with social programs

We have documented different types of programs for the chronic poor and vulnerable non-poor.

--

With a fixed, limited budget, which group should we target or which program should we implement first?

--

We often face "the paradox of social protection" (Ikegami et al. 2018).

--

Targeting the vulnerable non-poor can result in enhanced well-being of the poor in the medium term.

  - because it prevents the vulnerable from joining the group of chronic poor.
  
--

But it comes at the cost of not helping the current poor, implying higher current poverty.

---

# Some notes with social programs

It is important to identify the *causal determinants* of poverty.

--

If market failures (e.g. credit and insurance markets) are key constraints, then addressing these can generate indirect, longer-term general equilibrium benefits.

--

These benefits may not be captured in the short term.

--

For example, Bandiera et al. (2017) find a large asset-building program for poor women in Bangladesh also increased the low-skill wages received by non-participants.


---

class: inverse

Many social programs, such as cash transfers, and subsidies for education, healthcare, nutrition, housing, and utilities, often experience **demand exceeding available budgets**.

--

To address this challenge, we need a mechanism or an instrument that ensures these programs achieve their intended objectives while operating within a fixed budget. 

--

This requires identifying the target population effectively.

  Targeting of Social Assistance Programs
&lt;/div&gt; 




---

# Targeting

Targeting social assistance programs is difficult because:

- The agency often lacks full information about the income or needs of potential beneficiaries (**asymmetric information**).

--

This matters because it can cause **adverse selection**:

--
Some people who are less needy or ineligible might receive benefits,

--

- While some truly needy people might be left out.

--

Which leads to inefficient and unfair distribution of assistance.

--

Good targeting thus consists in devising methods to address this information problem.

--

There are four approaches to targeting:

--

- By income: *means tests*

--

- By another variable: *proxy means tests, geographic and demographic targeting*

--

- By local knowledge: *community targeting*
  
--

- By choices: *self-targeting*

---

# Means tests

The procedure involves an **official directly assess each applicant’s (household or individual) income** and compare it to a poverty line to determine eligibility.

--

This can be done in one of three ways:

--

- Self-Declaration with Third-Party Verification: applicants declare their income, which is then verified by an external entity (e.g., food stamps in the U.S.).
  
--

- Document-Based Verification: applicants provide official records such as tax returns or payroll data to prove income.

--

- In-Person Assessment: a program officer conducts a home visit and interview to visually assess living conditions, used when no formal records exist.

--

Each of these methods can be costly or inaccurate, making means tests rarely feasible for programs in developing countries.
  
---

# Proxy means tests

This uses **correlates of poverty** to calculate an individual score that can be compared to a threshold for program eligibility.

--

The idea is to identify a small number of characteristics `\(X_i\)` for individual or household `\(i\)` that are: 

  - strongly correlated with income or expenditure `\(y_i\)`
  
  - easy to observe, verifiable by others, and cannot be easily manipulated by the applicant
  
--

Using household survey data, we can estimate `\(\hat{\beta}\)`(s) from the following regression: 
`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1i} + ... + \beta_j X_{ji} + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

We can use these `\(\hat{\beta}\)`(s) to estimate a predicted `\(\hat{y}_i\)` for each applicant

- and compare it to a threshold value `\(z\)` for inclusion in the program.

---

# Community-based targeting

Community-based targeting consists in **delegating the selection of beneficiaries to the community**. 

--

A key advantage is that local knowledge allows for more accurate and cost-effective identification of those in need, leveraging social networks for enforcement and adapting poverty definitions to local conditions.

--

However, it is not without disadvantages: 
  
--

- Conflicting objectives: local agents prioritize personal/political interests over national goals.
  
--

- Elite capture &amp; corruption: local elites may misuse resources for personal gain.
  
--

- Less pro-Poor focus: local preferences may emphasize growth over poverty reduction.
  
--

- Community divisions: selecting beneficiaries in a tight-knit community can cause resentment.
  
--

- Weak capacity: local institutions lack the ability to collect &amp; manage data effectively.


---

# Self targeting

Instead of trying to guess the type of a person (poor or non-poor)

- **self-targeting seeks to have each person willingly reveal their type**. 

--

The approach can thus potentially be effective. 

--

However, even if self-selection is effective, it imposes costs on the poor. 

--

The costs are typically of two types: 

--

- Transaction costs: e.g., time to wait in line, incurring a stigma associated with participation

--

- Work requirements: e.g., work remunerated at a wage level attractive to the poor but not non-poor


---

# Example of self-targeting

In many rural areas, employment and income opportunities are **highly seasonal**, closely tied to agricultural cycles.

--

During **off-season periods**, jobs become scarce, income declines, increasing vulnerability to poverty &amp; food insecurity.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/fink2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Example of self-targeting

Imagine we want to design a **workfare program** that guarantees employment and income during these lean seasons.

--

What key factors should we consider to design an effective program, if we want to use self-targeting?

--

Consider two types of worker:

--

- Low type (the poor): they are currently working for a low wage `\(w_L\)`

  - with full time work ($l_L = 8$ hours), they would earn `\(w_Ll_L\)`, which is below the poverty line `\(w_Ll_L&lt;z\)`.
  
--

- High type (the non-poor): they are currently working for a high wage `\(w_H\)`:

  - with full time work ($l_H = 8$ hours), they would earn `\(w_Hl_H\)`, which is above the poverty line `\(w_Hl_H&gt;z\)`.

---

# The workfare program


For the self-targeting to work, the work contract of the workfare programs has to have three characteristics:

--

**Incentive compatibility constraint**

  - Let the program wage be `\(w\)`, the non-poor are not willing to participate when `\(w_L &lt; w &lt;w_H\)`

--

**Participation constraint**:

  - Let the program hours be `\(\bar{l}\)`, and residual time on the market be `\(l_L^{'} = 8 - \bar{l}\)`
  
  - Then the poor are willing to participate when `\(w\bar{l} + w_Ll_L^{'} &gt; w_Ll_L\)`

--

**Poverty elimination constraint**:

  - Participation in the program takes the poor out of poverty when 
  
`$$\text{income with the workfare} = w\bar{l} + w_Ll_L^{'}&gt;z$$`


---

# The workfare program

Under the ($w, \bar{l}$) offer, the non-poor would self-screen out of the workfare program

- because private work is more profitable to them (due to the separating work requirement).
  
--

For the poor, the program requires from them a fixed public-sector work contribution `\(\bar{l}\)` and they receive a flat transfer `\(w\bar{l}\)` for the work they do for the program.

--

The poor would self-screen into the program because it gives them an income above their opportunity cost on the labor market.

---

# The workfare program

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/workfare.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# Targeting errors

There are 2 types of targeting errors: 

- An *error of exclusion (Type I error)*: when  we categorize a poor (eligible) person as "non- poor" (noneligible).

- An *error of inclusion (Type II error)*:  when we categorize a non-poor (non-eligible) person as "poor" (eligible).

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/targeting_errors.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

There is a trade-off between the two losses. 


---

class: inverse 

We have covered different types of social assistance and how programs target beneficiaries.

--

Now, let’s ask some important policy questions:

- Is it better to transfer food directly or give cash to recipients?

- Should cash transfers come with conditions or be unconditional?

--

These questions go beyond practical design—they touch on how transfers affect the welfare and choices of recipients.

--

Economics offers simple but powerful tools to help us analyze these questions by thinking about:

- How people make choices based on their preferences,

- The limits they face on resources, and

- How different types of transfers affect their well-being.


---

# Social assistance and recipient choices

Social assistance aims to improve the well-being of recipients.

--

People have different needs and preferences: food, education, health, clothing, and more.

--

The type of transfer we provide affects the freedom recipients have to allocate resources according to their own priorities.

--

For example:

- A food transfer provides specific goods but limits choice.

--

- A cash transfer lets recipients decide how to best meet their needs.

--

Understanding these differences helps us think about how transfers impact welfare beyond just the amount given.


---

# Preferences and welfare

Recipients have different preferences over goods (e.g., food vs. clothing).

--

These preferences can be represented by indifference curves (curves showing equal satisfaction).

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/max1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Higher curves represent higher levels of well-being or welfare.


---

# Limited resources and choices

A budget line describes the combinations of goods that can be purchased 

- given the consumer’s income and the prices of the goods. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/max.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

The consumer maximizes utility at the tangency of the indifference curve and the budget line.


---

# Cash transfers vs. food transfers

Transfers give recipients a limited amount of resources to spend.

--

We can think of these limits as a **"budget constraint"** — the resources available to the recipient.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/max2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Cash transfers vs. food transfers

Transfers give recipients a limited amount of resources to spend.

*Cash transfers expand choices** by allowing purchases of different goods and services.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/max5.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Cash transfers vs. food transfers

Transfers give recipients a limited amount of resources to spend.

Food transfers allow recipient to consume more food (at least as much as the transfer).

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/max4.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Cash transfers vs. food transfers

Transfers give recipients a limited amount of resources to spend.

Food transfers allow recipient to consume more food (at least as much as the transfer).

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figtabs/max3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

but not other goods* ("unattainable region" between the two budget lines).

- unless there’s a perfect secondary market (which rarely exists)

---

# Cash transfers vs. food transfers

Cash transfers provide flexibility—recipients maximize their welfare by choosing what best suits their needs.

--

Food (in-kind) transfers restrict choice—recipients must consume at least the quantity of food provided, which may not match their preferences.

--

If the food transfer is smaller than what recipients would buy themselves (“infra-marginal”), food and cash transfers yield similar benefits.

--

If the food transfer is larger than optimal (“extra-marginal”), welfare is lower than cash—unless excess food can be sold easily.

--

In-kind transfers can distort choices and are only as good as cash if a perfect secondary market exists, which is rare.

--

Policy choice between food and cash should consider recipient preferences, market conditions, and local impacts.

&lt;div style="font-size: 26px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Cash vs. food transfers in practice: The case of Programa de Apoyo Alimentario
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Programa de Apoyo Alimentario

*Programa de Apoyo Alimentario*: is a randomized controlled trial across 300 Mexican villages.

--

There are three groups:

--

- Group 1: treatment villages that receive monthly in-kind food transfers

- Group 2: treatment villages receive monthly cash transfers of equivalent value

- Group 3: control villages that do not receive any transfers

--

Group discussion:

- What do you expect to happen to the local food price?

- How would these changes affect consumers?

- And how would they affect food producers, at least in the short run?


---

# Programa de Apoyo Alimentario

Cunha et al. (2011) evaluated this RCT and found that 

|                         | food transfers vs. control             | cash transfers vs. control                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| local price             | decreased                              | increased                                   |
| consumers               | direct transfer benefits               | direct transfer benefits                    |
|                         | + indirect benefits of decreased price | -- indirect costs of increased price        |
| producers (short-run)   |                                        | increased ag profits and production         |

--

In the longer run, the price increase due to cash transfers may be dampened by increasing supply, raising benefits to consumers, and inducing local economic growth. 

--

Cash transfers combined with supply-side policies to enhance supply response may be more appealing in the long-term policy even if food transfers may be the most appealing for consumers.

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  To condition or not to condition cash transfers?
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# UCT vs. CCT

If we just give people cash with no conditions, they have the freedom to decide what they need most. 

--

- This is called an **unconditional cash transfer (UCT)**.

--

Sometimes, governments want to encourage certain behaviors, like making sure children go to school or visiting the doctor. 

- They do this by adding rules.

- **Conditional cash transfers (CCT)** mean people only get the money if they meet those requirements.

--

So, what’s better?

--

Let’s discuss:

- Would you prefer to receive cash with no strings attached, or do you think conditions are a good idea? Why?


---

# UCT vs. CCT: empirical evidence

Baird et al. (2011) run an RCT with cash transfers to girls ages 13-22 in Malawi.

--

There are three groups:

- Group 1: 48 treatment schools with cash transfers conditional on school attendance.

- Group 2: 27 treatment schools with unconditional cash transfers.

- Group 3: 88 control schools with no transfers.

--

What impact do you think cash transfers might have on students’ academic performance?


---

# UCT vs. CCT: empirical evidence

Academic performance increases significantly with CCT.

--

Yet, there can be a trade-off in outcomes when using CCT vs. UCT.

|                         | CCT vs. control             | UCT vs. control              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **School attendance**   | +4 more school days/term    | +2 more school days/term      |
| **English test score**  | ↑ 0.14 SD                   | no effect                     |
| **Teenage pregnancy rate** | no effect                | ↓ 27%                         |
| **Teenage marriage rate**  | no effect                | ↓ 44%                         |

--

What mechanisms could explain the changes we see in school attendance, learning outcomes, and early life choices?


---

# Teenage pregnancy and marriage

&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Teenage pregnancy and marriage

In many contexts, child marriage is seen partly as an economic decision.

--

Families may marry off daughters early as a way to secure resources ("selling daughters").

--

Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) can relax these financial pressures, giving households more breathing room and reducing the incentive to marry daughters early.

--

This could explain why we see large decreases in teenage pregnancy and marriage rates with UCT in this setting.

  Do you have any questions?

---

# Main Takeaways

- Social assistance programs are essential tools to reduce poverty and protect vulnerable populations, especially in developing countries.

--

- Targeting is challenging due to asymmetric information, which can cause adverse selection and inefficiency in delivering benefits.

--

- Different types of transfers have different implications:

  - Cash transfers offer flexibility and generally maximize recipient welfare by allowing choice.

  - In-kind (food) transfers restrict choices and can be less efficient unless well matched to recipient needs and local market conditions.

--

- The debate over CCT vs. UCT centers on trade-offs between respecting recipient autonomy and promoting behavioral goals (like education or health).

--

- Both cash and conditions should be **tailored to local context and combined with complementary social services**.

--

- Effective social assistance policy requires balancing economic efficiency, social equity, administrative feasibility, and cultural sensitivity.
