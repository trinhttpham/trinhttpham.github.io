          We evaluate two randomized controlled trials in Bhutan testing whether near-peer mentoring can shift students’ educational preferences toward STEM and TVET pathways. Mentors provided personalized guidance, shared their ownexperiences, and offered information on admissions and labor market outcomes. The interventions significantly increased students’ interest and perceived knowledge, but had limited effects on actual applications or enrollment. In the STEM stream, limited follow-through appears linked to structural constraints such as academic selectivity and limited program capacity; for TVET, social stigma and parental skepticism likely
          played a constraining role. These findings highlight the potential of light-touch, scalable mentoring to shape aspirations, while underscoring the need for complementary strategies to support behavior change and enable follow-through.

          This paper provides a new explanation for ethnic disparities in education and health in Vietnam 
		by studying the relationship between frequent, small-scale adverse rainfall shocks and child human capital.
		Exploiting 	plausibly random year-to-year variation in weather data that are linked to a longitudinal 
		household- and individual-level dataset over the period 2008–2017, I find that excess rainfall 
		during the annual typhoon season results in lower child subjective health status and school enrollment,
		with disproportionate effects on children of ethnic minorities. The negative lagged effects on education 
		are concentrated in children at primary school start age, suggesting delaying children’s school entry is 
		a shock–coping strategy for poor ethnic minority households, albeit with potentially big negative long-run 
		effect on their child lifetime earnings. Estimates suggest that rainfall shocks can explain approximately 28% 
		of the observed ethnic gap in enrollment rates of children age 16–18 in the sample during the study period,
		and most is due to heterogeneous effects of rainfall shocks among ethnic groups, not differences in exposure to rainfall shocks.

          We combine nationally representative household and labor force survey data from 1992 to 2016 to provide 
				a detailed description of rural labor market evolution and how it relates to the structural transformation 
				of rural Vietnam, especially within the agricultural sector. Our study adds to the emerging literature on 
				structural transformation in low-income countries using micro-level data and helps to answer several 
				policy-related questions. We find limited employment creation potential of agriculture, especially for youth. 
				Rural-urban real wage convergence has gone hand-in-hand with increased diversification of the rural economy 
				into the non-farm sector nationwide and rapid advances in educational attainment in all sectors’ and regions’ 
				workforce. Minimum wage laws seem to have played no significant role in increasing agricultural wages. 
				This enhanced integration also manifests in steady attenuation of the longstanding inverse farm size-yield 
				relationship. Farming has remained securely household-based and the family farmland distribution has remained 
				largely unchanged. Small farm sizes have not obstructed mechanization nor the uptake of labor-saving pesticides,
				consistent with factor substitution induced by rising real wage rates. As rural households rely more heavily on 
				the labor market, human capital accumulation (rather than land endowments) have become the key correlate of 
				improvements in rural household well-being.

        Using nearly three decades of Vietnamese data, I document the heterogeneous effects
				of temperature changes on intersectoral labor reallocation across regions and demographics.
				Extreme heat generally shifts workers from agriculture to non-agriculture in
				both the short and long term. While all workers face similar probabilities of entering
				informal non-agricultural jobs, younger individuals are more likely to secure formal
				employment. In less globally integrated regions, extreme heat increases agricultural labor
				shares and reduces consumption expenditure. These findings align with a model
				of costly labor reallocation, emphasizing trade openness and intersectoral switching
				costs as critical factors linking climate shocks to employment dynamics.

       Leveraging the staggered roll-out of industrial zones in Vietnam and detailed household and individual survey data, 
	   this paper evaluates how place‑based industrialization shapes labor markets and household welfare. Labor responses 
	   are heterogeneous. Youth reduce labor force participation, increasing school enrollment and degree attainment. 
	   Prime-age adults shift away from agricultural employment, with reductions largest among those less attached to 
	   the sector, while hours remain unchanged for those who stay. Informal non-agricultural employment plays a key 
	   role in spreading welfare gains beyond formal jobs, particularly for less-educated individuals and households. 
	   These adjustments lead to broadly shared increases in labor income and household consumption. The findings 
	   highlight the importance of informality, multi-job livelihoods, and intra-household labor coordination in 
	   shaping the equitable distribution of industrialization's benefits in developing countries.

       Extreme heat increasingly threatens agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods, with farm-dependent communities particularly at risk. 
	   This study investigates whether proximity to industrial zones can help mitigate the adverse effects of extreme heat. 
	   Using detailed household survey data, high-resolution weather records, and geospatial data on the phased rollout of 
	   industrial zones, I find that while extreme heat significantly reduces agricultural output, households near industrial 
	   zones experience smaller declines in total income and consumption. This resilience is driven by labor reallocation 
	   into formal non-farm jobs within industrial zones, along with spillover benefits to household non-farm businesses, 
	   which see increased income as a result of improved local economic conditions. The findings underscore the role of 
	   rural industrial development in climate adaptation and suggest that expanding local non-farm job opportunities can 
	   foster climate-resilient rural livelihoods.
