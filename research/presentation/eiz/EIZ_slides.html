# Motivation

- Governments worldwide increasingly use targeted industrial policies, like special economic zones (SEZs), to boost growth, especially in lagging regions.

--

- By 2019, over 5,400 special economic zones were established.

  - More than 90% in low- and middle-income countries (UNCTD, 2019).

--

- Yet, limited causal evidence from developing countries on how these policies affect labor markets and broader welfare.

--

- Majority of existing literature research focuses on firm-level outcomes (employment, productivity, exports) and high-income contexts.

--

  - These findings, while informative, have limited guidance for policymakers in low-income settings, where labor markets are highly informal and household livelihoods are typically more diversified. 


---

# This paper 

--

- Asks **whether special economic zones only benefit a narrow segment of the population such as highly educated workers**.

--

  - **Or can they generate broader welfare gains for less advantaged groups?**
  
--

  - And if so, what are the potential mechanisms?
  
  
--

- Leverages the staggered rollout of industrial zones (IZ) in Vietnam as a natural experiment.

--

- Combines a detailed geospatial database of more than 250 industrial zones over 100 districts

--

  - with 10 waves of the household-level repeated cross sections 2002-2020.

--

- Method: staggered DiD design using **de Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (dCH, 2020, 2024)**

--

  - Treatment defined by **residence within 10-km radius of a newly established zone**.
  
--
  
  - Motivated by earlier evidence in other settings and distance-based analysis.
  
  
---

# Preview of findings

**Labor Supply Responses**: strong heterogeneity by age and education

--

- Youth: `\(\downarrow\)` labor supply, `\(\uparrow\)` schooling and credentials.

- Older educated adults: `\(\downarrow\)` labor supply, suggestive evidence of `\(\uparrow\)` domestic tasks or early retirement.

- Prime-age adults: no change.

--

**Sectoral Employment Shifts**: `\(\downarrow\)` agricultural work, **mainly non-core workers (less attached to farming)**.

--

- `\(\uparrow\)` non-agricultural jobs.

  - Both educated and less-educated: more formal work, longer hours. 
  
  - Less-educated: also expand into informal non-farm work. 
  
--

**Household Impacts**: Greater diversification of work across sectors and among members.

--

- Wage gains higher for educated, but offset by informal work for less-educated `\(\rightarrow\)` similar total income growth.

--

- Comparable rises in per capita consumption across households regardless of education level.

**Structural transformation and labor reallocation**

--

- Literature: Classic models emphasize sharp agriculture to industry transitions (Lewis, 1954; Herrendorf et al., 2014)

  - Recent evidence points to gradual, fragmented shifts (McMillan et al., 2014; Merotto et al., 2018)
  - Previous place-based policies literture in developing countries focus on workers’ primary jobs and aggregate sectoral outcomes (e.g., Abagna et al., 2025; Gallé et al., 2024; Tafese et al., 2025).

--

- **Contribution**: Show that **IZ-driven reallocation occurs mainly in secondary agricultural work**, highlighting extensive-margin adjustments among weaker farm attachments.


--

**Household Diversification and Informality**

- Literature: Household diversification typically framed as risk-sharing (Barrett et al., 2001; Dercon, 2002; Rosenzweig &amp; Stark, 1989; Udry, 1996); informality seen as residual sector (Fields, 2011; La Porta &amp; Shleifer, 2014; Maloney, 2004). 

--

- **Contribution**: Demonstrate that limited IZ access spurs **opportunity-driven diversification**—especially via informal nonfarm work—**informality as central to broad-based welfare gains**.

  Institutional Background
&lt;/div&gt; 



---

# Industrial Zone Establishment in Vietnam 

**Goals**: attract FDI, boost exports, create jobs.

- IZs equipped with dedicated infrastructure, providing various investment incentives.
  
--

**Governance**:

- National (Ministry of Planning and Investment MPI): planning, approval, integration into master plans.
  
- Provincial Peoples' Committee: site selection, incentives, local implementation.
  
--

- This decentralized yet collaborative model allows for top-down strategic direction while remaining responsive to local development needs.
  
  
--

**Management boards**: oversee operations, services, compliance.

    &lt;img src="figures/evolution_eiz.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- 1990s: Fewer than 50 zones; Decree 192/CP (1994) created first legal framework, spurring steady growth.
- Around 2000: FDI Law reforms liberalized investment `\(\rightarrow\)` rapid surge in zones (100 `\(\rightarrow\)` 200+).

  Data Source 
&lt;/div&gt;

# Data and Variable Construction 

**Main Data**

--

- Industrial Zone Database (MPI): establishment date, location, status, performance indicators; 

  - manually georeferenced &amp; linked to harmonized districts (approximately 650).
  
--

- Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS, 2002–2020): 10 waves, approximately 45,000 households each wave

--

**Constructed Variables**

- Labor market outcomes: primary/secondary jobs, hours of work

  - formal vs. informal work (whether to work for household businesses--employer-based definition)
  - labor income (including imputed household business earnings).
  
--

- Youth outcomes: schooling participation &amp; child labor (10–18).

--

- Household outcomes: consumption (food, non-food, education) 

  - labor diversification (across members, across sectors, multiple jobs).

  Empirical Strategy
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Empirical Challenges

This paper estimates the causal effects of industrial zones on individual-level labor outcomes and household-level labor diversification and consumption expenditure.

--

**The establishment of industrial zones, however, are not exogenous**.

--

**Zones established after 2002 tend to be located in more disadvantaged areas**.

  - lower levels of urbanization, greater reliance on agricultural employment, a smaller share of non-agricultural jobs,
  
  - lower labor income from both wage work and household enterprises.
  
  - children more likely to be engaged in economic activities and less likely to attend school.

---

# Empirical Challenges

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/summary.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Empirical Strategy 

Event-study model: 

`$$y_{idt} = \alpha_d + \delta_{t} + \sum_{k=-3, k\neq 0}^{6} \beta_k \cdot \mathbb{I}(t = \text{Establishment}_d + k) + \varepsilon_{idt}$$`

--

- `\(y_{idt}\)` is the outcome of individual or household `\(i\)` in district `\(d\)` at time `\(t\)`.  

- District fixed effects `\(\alpha_d\)` absorb district-specific time-invariant heterogeneity.

- Year fixed effects `\(\delta_{t}\)` control for year-specific shocks. 

- The coefficients `\(\beta_k\)` capture dynamic treatment effects `\(k\)` years relative to **establishment**. 

- Standard errors `\(\varepsilon_{idt}\)` are clustered at the district level to account for temporal/spatial correlation.


---

# Treatment Definition 

**Temporal Variation**: Treatment begins when a zone is **established**

- Defined as approval of secondary projects (even before full infrastructure completion).

- Rationale: Captures onset of land clearance, infrastructure work, and investment decisions `\(\rightarrow\)` reflects when expectations and development activity begin.
  
--

**Spatial Variation**: Districts classified as treated from **the first year they fall within 10 km of an established zone**

- and remain treated thereafter.
  
- Only one zone had been terminated as of June 2023 due to delays in infrastructure development.

  &lt;img src="figures/plotid1_2008.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Treatment Definition

**The 10-km radius is motivated by recent evidence that spatial spillovers from industrial zones tend to diffuse outward from their core areas** (Duranton &amp; Venables, 2018; Gallé et al., 2024)

  - significant employment effects within 10-15 km radius of SEZ in India (Gallé et al., 2024)
  - significant wealth effects within 10 km radius across several African countries (Abagna et al., 2025)

--

This is also corroborated by results from a distance-based analysis:

`$$y_{dt} = \alpha_d + \delta_t + \sum_{b=0, b\neq 5}^{9}\delta_b \text{POST}_t\times \text{Distance}_{d = b} + \theta \text{POST}_t  + \varepsilon_{dt}$$`

- `\(\text{POST}_t\)` is a binary indicator for the post-treatment period.
- `\(\text{Distance}_{d = b}\)` indicates whether district `\(d\)` falls within distance bin `\(b\)` from the industrial zone. 
  - `\(b=0\)` represents the zone-hosting district.
  - `\(b=1\)` corresponds to districts within 0-5 km from the zone.
  - `\(b=2\)` represents districts within 5-10 km.
  - `\(b=3\)` for districts within 10-15 km, and so on, in 5 km increments up to 45 km for `\(b = 9\)`. 
  - `\(b=5\)` (20-25km) as the reference bin.

# Empirical Concerns 

Estimating the model using traditional TWFE can have two limitations (e.g., Borusyak et al., 2024; de
 Chaisemartin &amp; d’Haultfoeuille, 2020; Goodman-Bacon, 2021)
 
--

  - TWFE biased under heterogeneous treatment effects `\(\rightarrow\)` implicit weights distort estimates (overweight early-treated units, early–late comparisons).
  - TWFE poorly captures dynamic effects `\(\rightarrow\)` cannot track delayed or evolving impacts over time.
 
--

These concerns are particularly relevant in this setting.

  - Early zones likely in higher-potential areas `\(\rightarrow\)` stronger initial impacts.
  - Zone impacts evolve gradually as projects scale and investment deepens.
  
--

To address these concerns, I estimate the model following de Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020, 2024)

--

  - For each group that changes its treatment in a given period (a "switcher"), the estimator compares the outcome evolution of the switcher to the set of units ("stayers") *with the same baseline treatment status who do not change treatment in that period*.
  - This avoids forbidden comparisons between early and late adopters.
  
---

# Empirical Concerns

Another concern is (mis)alignment of treatment and outcome timing.

--

- Challenge: Zones established annually; VHLSS outcomes observed every 2 years `\(\rightarrow\)` temporal mismatch.

--

- Baseline approach: Retrospectively align treatment to next survey year (e.g., 2009 zone `\(\rightarrow\)` treated in 2010). Period 1 = 2 years post-treatment, up to period 6 (12 years) to maintain precision.

--

- Robustness: de Chaisemartin et al. (2024) Split-sample estimation.

  - First sample includes never-treated group-years, and observations where the group experienced a **treatment change in a year when outcomes are observed**. 
  
    - The event-study coefficients capture the effect of treatment exposure over odd-numbered intervals.
    
  - Second sample includes never-treated group-years, and those in which **treatment changes occurred in years when outcomes are not observed**. 
  
    - The event-study coefficients correspond to even-numbered exposure intervals

# Labor Participation 

Labor force participation among young individuals (ages 19 to 24) declines steadily and significantly.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/m_worked_s1_age1_edu0.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 350px;" /&gt;

# Labor Participation 

This effect is concentrated among young individuals without a high school diploma.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Labor Participation 

There are some **suggestive evidence of decreasing labor participation among older individuals with high school diploma**.

--

- This likely does not reflect labor displacement.

--

- But rather a **voluntary choice among the more educated**, increasingly engaged in household chores.

# Primary Sector Employment

**Gradual and significant decline in agricultural employment as primary economic activity**.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

# Secondary Sector Employment 

The decline in agricultural engagement as secondary job is more pronounced.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/emp2.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Hours of Work 

Total agricultural hours decline by approximately 5.5%.

- Yet conditional hours remain unchanged. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/hours.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Intersectoral Labor Reallocation: Summary 

Adjustment occurs mainly on the extensive margin. 

- `\(\rightarrow\)` weaker-attached (esp. secondary job holders) exit agriculture; remaining workers sustain hours.

--

By education:

- Less-educated `\(\rightarrow\)` shift to informal non-farm (often secondary jobs).

- More-educated `\(\rightarrow\)` move into formal sectors, exit informal roles.

--

These patterns underscore the value of accounting for secondary employment, 

- and sector hours in understanding structural change in settings characterized by multi-activity livelihoods.

---

class: inverse 

The results can be grouped into four main outcome categories:

- Labor Force Participation

- Individual-Level Sectoral Labor Reallocation

- **Household-Level Labor Allocation and Diversification**

- From Labor Strategies to Welfare Outcomes


---

# Household-Level Labor Allocation and Diversification 

**Across-member diversification**:

- `\(= 1\)` if members work in different sectors (e.g., ag and non-ag); 0 if all in same sector.
- Captures sectoral variety across household members.

--

**Within-member diversification**:

- `\(= 1\)` if any member holds jobs in more than one sector; 0 otherwise.
- Captures multi-sector work by individuals.

--

**Labor diversification index**:

- Continuous Herfindahl-based measure of how household labor hours are spread across sectors.
`$$\text{Index} = 1 - \sum_{j} \left( \frac{\text{hours}_j}{\sum_j\text{hours}_j}\right) ^2$$`
where `\(j\)` indexes sectors (agriculture, formal non-agriculture, and informal non-agriculture). Values closer to 1 indicate greater labor diversification across sectors; values near 0 imply concentration in a single sector.
- Captures overall intensity of diversification.


---

# Household-Level Labor Allocation and Diversification 

Households without a high school graduate tend to increase labor diversification across sectors.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/plu1_s1_edu0.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 350px;" /&gt;

# Household-Level Labor Allocation and Diversification 

IZs increase household labor diversification across members &amp; sectors.

--

But this effect is **entirely driven by households without a high school graduate**.

--

`\(\rightarrow\)` labor diversification serves as a strategic response for those with limited access to stable, high-return formal employment. 

--

In the absence of educational credentials needed for such jobs,

- less-educated households rely on sectoral diversification to navigate segmented labor markets.

# Labor Strategies and Household Welfare

Given the distinct patterns of labor adjustment observed, the implications for household welfare are not straightforward.

- some members leaving paid employment—whether to pursue education or assume domestic responsibilities—may reduce total income.

- transitions into higher-quality jobs (agriculture to informal or formal non-agricultural work) could improve earnings potential. 

--

The following focuses on how these shifts in labor allocation impact material well-being by analyzing changes in 

- individual labor earnings 

- and household consumption following industrial zone exposure.

# Labor Compensation Improvement 

Improved labor compensation **from wage work and household activities**.

# Labor Compensation Improvement 

Focusing on individuals reporting positive household-activity income, income growth effects are similar.

`\(\rightarrow\)` supports the view that place-based industrial policies can generate localized economic multipliers.

--

- **extending benefits even to those not directly employed in the industrial zones**.


---

class: inverse

The results so far underscore the **differential pathways through which individuals benefit** from industrial zone development.

- Lower-educated workers rely on both wage and informal household-based income.

- More educated workers benefit predominantly through formal employment channels. 

--

Despite these differential labor responses, **the broader effects point to improved household welfare**.

# Household Consumption Improvement 

Comparable improvement in household consumption across households with different education levels.

# Household Consumption Improvement

Household welfare gains also extend to improved outcomes for school-age children, particularly adolescents.

- No significant impacts on very young children (10-14).

- Reduced labor and increased school attendance among adolescents (15-18).

--

Education-related expenditures increase by 25-30% for both age groups relative to pre-treatment levels. 

- These patterns are consistent across households irrespective of educational attainment. 

--

Households are allocating income gains toward human capital investment.

- supporting longer-term improvements in children's well-being.

---

# Robustness Checks 

The results presented so far are robust to:

- **The choice of comparison group**: never treated and not-yet-treated vs. never-treated only.

- **Alternative inference**: standard errors clustered at the district vs. province level.

- **SUTVA**: distance-based analysis supports the decay of effects beyond 10-km radius.

- **Demographic composition and migration**: sample of long-term residents vs. all households.

  - controlling vs. not controlling for individual characteristics (age, gender)

- **Alternative staggered DiD estimator**: Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna (2021).

- **Mismatch between treatment and outcome timing**: Sample splitting.

# Conclusion 

This paper provides new evidence on the labor market dynamics and welfare impacts of place-based industrial policy.

--

- Industrial zones drive labor reallocation out of agriculture, especially among those loosely tied to agriculture.

  - Those remain in agriculture sustain their working hours.

--

- Households—particularly less-educated—diversify across formal and informal work.

--

- Diversification offsets limited access to high-return formal jobs, spreading welfare gains.

  - Income gains are allocated toward human capital investment.

--

These highlight that industrial zones can foster inclusive growth,

- but need complementary support for agriculture and education.

--

More broadly, this research demonstrates the **importance of considering multi-activity livelihoods and intra-household adaptation** when assessing the welfare impacts of industrialization in the Global South.

--

- Where informality and diversified income portfolios are common, **focusing only on formal employment gains understates the reach of industrial policy**.
