# Plan for this week


- We begin by discussing the field of development economics and its evolution over the past 60 years.

--

- We will then discuss how we approach development economics in this course.

--

- Finally, we will spend some time talking about doing research in general.

  What is development economics?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The evolution of development economics 

- Classical economists of 17th, 18th, 19th century were all development economists (Bardhan 1993)

  - as they focused on the process of economic transformation that turned a country (in most case Britain) from predominantly agrarian to predominantly industrial

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

# What is meant by development economics today?

McKenzie and Paffhausen (2017)'s study on more than 200 development economics courses.

--

They documented considerable heterogeneity in what is considered development economics.

--

There are 4 main views: 
  
  - theoretical macro-based approach: economic growth, trade, industrial policy
  
  - empirical micro-based approach (randomization and other impact evaluation): credit and risk, land, labor markets
  
  - mixed approach narrowly focused on common core topics: growth, poverty and inequality, human capital, institutions
  
  - expansive approach covering a broader range of topics: rural development and agriculture, the role of aid, migration, entrepreneurship, behavioral factors in decision-making

  How we approach development economics in this course?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Before answering this question, let's first look at some statistics.
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# There are significant differences in per capita income across countries 
 
What is GNI? How is it different from GDP? What is PPP? How can we compare income across countries?

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/gnipc.png" style="width: 70%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# These income differences matter

Generally, **higher income** is associated with **lower infant mortality**

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/income_infantm.png" style="width: 70%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# These income differences matter

Generally, **higher income** is associated with **higher life expectancy**

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/income_lifexpt.png" style="width: 70%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# These income differences matter

Generally, **higher income** is associated with **higher literacy**

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/income_literacy.png" style="width: 70%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# These income differences matter

... but **gender gaps** remain an issue in many settings

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/income_literacy_male.png" style="width: 70%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Our approach 

Try to understand these differences using an **empirical micro-based approach**

--

Identify and understand micro-level economic problems faced by poor individuals/households

  - with a focus on labor (education, health, productivity, labor markets)
  
--

Why labor? 

--

  - For low-income households, labor is their main asset

--

Then we will briefly discuss how those micro-level problems have implications on the development process

--

Our main goal is to identify potential solutions to those economic problems based on rigorous causal-and-effect evidence

  Course overview 
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Course snapshot 

**Weeks 2-3: causal inference and empirical strategies**

  - We will review common approaches to conduct causal-and-effect analysis

  - RCT (brief intro, covered in details by Prof. Sungho Park in another course)
  
  - Instrumental Variables, Difference-in-Differences, Regression Discontinuity

--

**Week 4: poverty traps and ultra-poor programs**

  - Does being poor keep you poor? 
  
  - What we can do to help people escape poverty? 
  

---

# Course snapshot 

**Weeks 5-6: human capital (education and health)**

  - How much will our earnings increase for each additional level of schooling completed? (returns to schooling)
  
  - What are constraints to education and health accumulation?  
  
--

We wil discuss in details some of the following questions:
  
  - Do parents hold *inaccurate beliefs* about their children's academic abilities and therefore make misguided investments? for example, by purchasing educational supplements that are too advanced for their children (information constraints). How can we help parents make better investment decisions?
    
  - When there is negative income shock to the households, are all children affected equally? What are the implications for social safety net programs, such as cash transfers?
    
  - We make choices within social contexts and are concerned about how these choices affect our *social image* (social signaling). Can we leverage this concept to boost some policy take-up rates? 
  
---

# Course snapshot 

**Weeks 7-8: rural and urban labor markets**

  - How efficient are rural labor markets?
  
    - Why do wages tend to remain inflexible despite changes in economic conditions?

    - There are fluctuations in labor demand and supply that occur throughout the year due to the seasonal nature of agricultural production (seasonality). How can we ensure employment (and income) stability of workers?
  
--

  - Frictions to job search and hiring in urban labor markets
    
    - Why do firms hire using referrals?
    
    - What can we do to increase matching between firms and workers, given that they have with limited information about workseeker's skills?
    
---

# Course snapshot

**Week 9: structural change of the labor markets**

  - Contrasting features in labor markets between developed and developing countries
  
  - Role of agriculture in structural change and development
  
    - Does agricultural productivity growth (e.g., Green Revolution) make people move out of agriculture to join other sectors? What are implications for development?

--

**Week 10: development and the environment**

  - How do environmental and climate changes affect development?
    
    - How can we mitigate those adverse impacts? focus on human capital outcomes (mortality, labor productivity)

  - How does economic development influence the environment?
  
    - How should we think about the link between rural road construction - farm labor - and crop residue burning?

  - What can we do to minimize the adverse impacts of economic development on the environment?

    - Example, payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation and crop residue burning

  Doing research
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Doing research

- Research is to make some discoveries/generating some new knowledge.

- How big or how new are the discoveries that we need to be a successful PhD student?

  - Being successful does not mean writing papers that could be published in **top 5 journals**

  - It means writing and defending a dissertation or a thesis that contributes to the literature, even just a little bit
  
    - and of course getting (or continuing) the job you want

---

# Writing a dissertation (or a paper)

- There is no single right way to do it, but you have to do it!

- There is no "right topic", but work on something that is important and genuinely interests you

  - You will need to spend the next few months/years to finish a research project
  
    - So you probably do not want to work on something that you find boring
  
  - You will need to find (an) important topic(s) to work on
  
    - Because it takes just as much time to write on an unimportant topic as an important topic
    
    - Though it takes a lot of time to write a **good paper**

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  What is considered important topic? 
&lt;/div&gt; 

---


# What is considered important topic?

- When you have a new research idea, ask yourself "Why should people care?"

  - Can you think of real-world examples of why it matters? 
  
  - By answering your research questions, which policy implications can we have?
  
- Real-world impacts + new knowledge (even just a bit) = important topic


---

# Where to look for ideas?

- Top journals 
  - Top-5 journals: American Economic Review (AER), Journal of Political Economy (JPE), Econometrica, Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), Review of Economic Studies (REStud)
  - Top general interests: AEJ Policy/Applied, Review of Economics and Statistics (REStat), Economic Journal (EJ), Journal of the European Economic Association (JEEA)
  - Review journals: Journal of Economic Literature/Perspectives, Annual Review of Economics
  - Other top field journals

- Good working paper series: National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD), Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), World Bank Policy Research Working Papers

- Seminars: e.g., VDEV/CEPR/BREAD virtual development seminars: https://cepr.org/events/event-series/virtual-development-economics-series

- Big names in your field
  
- Newspapers, books, even in other fields

---

# Can you formulate your ideas as research questions?

- Although purely descriptive research is important, the most interesting research with clear policy implications tends to be about questions of cause and effect

  - What is the causal effect of schooling on wages?
  
  - What is the causal effect of unemployment insurance on labor market outcomes?
  
  - What is the causal effect of providing cash transfers on children's school enrollment?
  
--

- For these questions, think of an ideal experiment that could be used to capture the causal effect of interest

  - Note that "the effect of a cause is always relative to another cause"

  - If you cannot think of such an experiment, then the odds of generating useful results with nonexperimental data seem slim

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Some research questions are **fundamentally unidentified questions**
&lt;/div&gt; 


---


# Fundamentally unidentified questions

Suppose we are interested in knowing the effect of school start age on students' test scores.

--

What could be an ideal experiment? 

--

We might randomly select kids and put them into 2 groups:
  
  - Group 1: kids to start first grade at age 6
    
  - Group 2: kids to start first grade at age 7
    
then measure the difference in first grade test score.

--

- Q1: Is there any problem with this experiment? 

- Q2: Does the difference in test score capture the effect of start age?

---

# Fundamentally unidentified questions

Suppose we are interested in knowing the effect of school start age on students' test scores.

- Q1: Is there any problem with this experiment? No

- Q2: Does the difference in test score capture the effect of start age?
  
  - Yes, but also **pure maturation effect**: Group 2 is older, and older kids tend to do better on tests.
  
  
--

If it also captures the pure maturation effect, can we fix the design by holding age constant instead of grade? 

We might randomly select kids and put them into 2 groups:

  - Group 1: kids to start at age 6, test when they are in second grade
    
  - Group 2: kids to start at age 7, test when they are in first grade

--

The difference between the two groups also reflects **time-in-school effect**: Group 1 has more time at school, and can do better if schooling matters.

--

This implies that there is no way we can disentangle the **effect of school start age** on learning from **maturation** and **time-in-school effects** as long as kids are still in school.

---

# Fundamentally unidentified questions

Suppose we are interested in knowing the effect of school start age on students' test scores.

The main problem is that as long as kids are in school:
    
  - They cannot potentially start school at *different* ages, 
  
  - and then take the test at *same* age after one year of schooling
    
  - i.e., school start age = current age - time in school
  
--

When do you think *this linear relationship does not hold*? 

--

  - People in adulthood: they can potentially start school at *different* ages, 
  
  - and then earn wages at *same* age after the same years of schooling 
  
  - i.e., school start age `\(\neq\)` current age - time in school
  
--

This means while we cannot study the effect of school start age on students' test scores, we can **twist the research question** a little bit by studying the effect of school start age on **adult labor market outcomes (earnings)**.

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  What about your research questions? Can you think of any other fundamentally unidentified questions? 
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Now that you have ideas with identified research questions, how to determine if it is worth spending time on them?
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Good and bad ideas

When you have an idea with an identified research question, ask yourself the following:

  - Do I get the fact(s) right? i.e., are my research questions based on some true real-world observations?
  
  - Do I have the right data to answer the research questions?
  
  - If the effect is there, would it be statistically detectable? i.e., is the sample size large enough?
  
  - Is the paper still interesting if I do not find any statistically significant results?
  
  - Can I complete this project in reasonable time? (you have very short time for PhD at KDIS)


---

# How to write a paper?

The paper must be focused: *"Do one thing and do it completely"* - Richard Blundell
  
  - Do not try to do many things at the same time
  
  - Do not write everything you know about the subject
  
--
  
Your paper tells an interesting and convincing story

  - Think about a jigsaw puzzle
  
    - You have a big picture (paper setup), and every piece (result) should fit into that picture
    
    - Having more pieces or using hard-shaped pieces does not necessarily mean better
    
--

As you read research papers, think about how the authors structure their stories and how they present results to make the stories believable

  - Pay a lot of attention to writing

    - 1 minute: research question &amp; your findings
    
    - 5 minutes: research question &amp; data &amp; empirical strategy &amp; your findings 
    
    - 15-20 minutes (or longer): full presentation with slides
    
  - Always be prepared to discuss similarities and differences between your paper and others working on the same question
    
  - A useful link to prepare slides for your full presentation
