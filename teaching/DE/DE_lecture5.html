class: inverse 

So, we see that more people are staying in school longer, but that doesn’t automatically mean they’re learning more. 

--

And yet, the learning that does happen is strongly tied to income — richer countries tend to have more learning, and within countries, higher-income individuals tend to achieve more academically.

--

This raises an important question: if education is so valuable, why don’t we see everyone maximizing their learning? 

--

What drives people to invest in education in the first place — and why do those choices differ?

--

To answer that, we need a framework for understanding how individuals make decisions about education.

---

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  A theoretical framework of education decision 
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# A simple theoretical framework of education decision

We assume education is an individual (not a household-level) decision, and it is based on weighing its costs and benefits. 

--

Let us consider a simple model of education decision (Magruder 2009): Individuals live for two periods: youth and adulthood. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="figures/earnings.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  

--

  - While in school, students receive intrinsic benefits `\(i\)`, and pay direct costs `\(c\)` (e.g., intuition).
  
--

  - If individuals without schooling work, they receive unskilled wage `\(w_0\)`
  
  - If individuals with schooling work, they receive skilled wage `\(w_1 &gt; w_0\)`
  


---

# A simple theoretical framework of education decision

  
Individuals discount future benefits at the rate `\(\delta = \frac{1}{1 + r} &lt;1\)` 

  - Here `\(\delta\)` is the "discount factor", and `\(r\)` is the "discount rate".
    
--

Individuals will decide to go to school when young if discounted lifetime benefits are greater with school than without 

`$$\underbrace{i - c + \delta w_1}_{\text{net gain with school}} &gt;  \underbrace{w_0 + \delta w_0}_{\text{net gain without school}}$$`

--

or equivalently if:

`$$\underbrace{i + \delta (w_1 - w_0)}_{\text{intrinsic + wage benefits}} &gt;  \underbrace{c + w_0}_{\text{direct + opp cost}}$$`

---

# A simple theoretical framework of education decision

The private decision to go to school depends on the **five determinants** suggested by this equation. 

`$$\underbrace{i + \delta (w_1 - w_0)}_{\text{intrinsic + wage benefits}} &gt;  \underbrace{c + w_0}_{\text{direct + opp. cost}}$$`

--

**Intrinsic value** of education `\((i)\)`: identity, peer networks, culture

--

**Expected returns** from schooling `\((w_1 - w_0)\)`: availability of employment opportunities, information about returns

--

**Direct cost** of schooling `\((c)\)`: influenced by supply-side aspects of educational services (e.g., distance, free/subsidized education)

--

**Opportunity cost** of schooling `\((w_0)\)`: 
  
  - e.g., child labor as a substitute for parent time in producing z-goods (fetching water, collecting firewood, taking care of younger
 siblings), or on the labor market

--

**Discount factor** `\((\delta = \frac{1}{1 + r})\)`: the higher the discount rate `\(r\)`, the lower the discount factor `\(\delta\)`, and the lower the present value of
 future benefits `\(w_1 - w_0\)` against which costs are compared
  
  
---

class: inverse





This framework shows us that education decisions are shaped by a mix of intrinsic value, costs, opportunity costs, and how people value the future. 

--

But notice that one factor runs like a thread through many of these decisions — the expected returns to schooling.

--

Whether a family decides to keep a child in school often hinges on what they believe education will bring in terms of higher earnings, better jobs, or other tangible benefits. 

--

And those beliefs don’t always match reality.

--

Let’s now zoom in on this idea of ‘returns to education’ — how we measure it, what it actually is in the data, and why it can differ so much across contexts.

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Estimating return to schooling 
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Estimating returns to schooling: econometric issues

Assume we are interested in estimating the return to schooling:

  - i.e., the percentage increase in a person’s earnings (or other measurable outcomes) associated with an additional year of education or a higher qualification, holding other factors constant.

--

We estimate the following equation:

$$ log(y_i) = \alpha + \beta S_i + \varepsilon_i$$ 

--

Does estimating the above equation with OLS yields unbiased estimate of the return to schooling?

--
Why or why not?

--

Schooling is **not randomly assigned**.

--

People with higher innate ability, stronger family support, better health, or more perseverance tend to both:

  - Stay in school longer
  
  - Earn more regardless of schooling
  
--

If we don’t control for those unobserved factors `\(U_i\)`, the estimated coefficient on schooling will capture both the true causal effect of schooling and the effect of those omitted variables (**omitted variable bias**).

---

# Estimating returns to schooling: econometric issues

We estimate the following equation:

$$ log(y_i) = \alpha + \beta S_i + \varepsilon_i$$ 

If we don’t control for those unobserved factors `\(U_i\)`, the estimated coefficient on schooling will capture both the true causal effect of schooling and the effect of those omitted variables (**omitted variable bias**).

--

The OVB formula (see lecture 2): `\(\quad OVB = \gamma * \delta \quad\)`, where `\(U_i = \delta S_i + \zeta_i\)`, and `\(Y_i = \beta S_i + \gamma U_i + \eta_i\)`
  
--

  - If the omitted traits are positively correlated with both schooling `\((\delta &gt; 0)\)` and earnings `\((\gamma &gt; 0)\)` then upward bias (we overstate the true causal return).

--

  - If some omitted factors work in the opposite direction (e.g., disadvantaged students who struggle stay in school longer because they have fewer immediate work options), we have downward bias.


---

# Instrumental variables for schooling

A standard solution to estimate the return to schooling is to look for supply-side sources of variation in schooling.

--

An **instrumental variable** for schooling must satisfy three conditions:

--
What are these conditions?

--

  - relevance: IV must affect schooling choices.
  
  - independence: IV must not be correlated with the other unobserved traits.
  
  - exclusion: IV must not affect (e.g., labor market) outcomes if not through schooling.
  
--

Examples of supply-side sources of variation in schooling:

  - Minimum school-leaving age.
  
  - Tuition costs.
  
  - Geographic proximity of schools.
  

---

# Card (2001)'s IV estimates of return to schooling

If an instrument induces equal change in schooling for all groups, IV estimates the average return to schooling `\(\bar{\beta}\)`.

--

If not, IV estimate is a weighted average of individual return to schooling.

- Weight equals to the relative size of the induced schooling change.

- This is a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) (for the group of compliers).

--

IV estimates can also be biased:

--

  - Upward bias `\((b_{iv}&gt;\bar{\beta})\)` can arise due to "discount rate bias"

    - Marginal return declines with education so those with higher marginal costs (who are more effected by cost reduction) tend to have higher marginal return.
    
--

  - Downward bias `\((b_{iv}&lt;\bar{\beta})\)` can arise if people with higher marginal costs of schooling tend to have lower return of schooling.


---

# Duflo (2001)'s returns to schooling

Background: school building program in Indonesia in the 1970s: 

  - The program set a target number of primary schools to be built in each of the country's 281 districts, based on the enrollment rate of primary-school age children in the district in 1972.
  
--

Duflo (2001) studies the effect of this program on education attainment, earnings, and then estimate the returns to schooling.

  - Idea: the program should have a bigger effect for children who entered school later in 1970s and *no effect* for children who finished primary school before 1974.
  
  - Empirically, use interactions of year of  birth with program intensity in the district of birth as instruments for schooling.


---

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/duflo.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Duflo (2001)'s returns to schooling

Depending on specifications, IV estimates are somewhat larger in magnitude but also less precise.

  - and none is significantly different from the corresponding OLS estimate.

--

Different interpretations according to Card (2001):

--

  - OLS estimates biased downward because measurement errors, which are then corrected by IVs. 
  
    - This is less compelling.
  
--

  - Returns to education are heterogeneous across individuals and supply-side based IVs recover returns to education for a subset of individuals with relatively high returns to education.
  
    - Under this scenario, both OLS and IV estimates are likely to be upward-biased estimates of the average marginal return to education.

  Constraints to schooling and interventions
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Education interventions

Recall that the private decision to go to school depends on the **five determinants**. 

`$$\underbrace{i + \delta (w_1 - w_0)}_{\text{intrinsic + wage benefits}} &gt;  \underbrace{c + w_0}_{\text{direct + opp. cost}}$$`

**Intrinsic value** of education `\((i)\)`: e.g., identity, peer networks, culture

**Expected returns** from schooling `\((w_1 - w_0)\)`: e.g., employment opportunities, information about returns

**Direct cost** of schooling `\((c)\)`: influenced by supply-side aspects of educational services (e.g., distance, free/subsidized education)

**Opportunity cost** of schooling `\((w_0)\)`: e.g., child labor

**Discount factor** `\((\delta = \frac{1}{1 + r})\)` 


---

# Education interventions

**Expected returns** from schooling `\((w_1 - w_0)\)`: 

  - change in school quality: teacher attendance (Duflo et al. 2012), teacher performance/incentives (Glewwe et al. 2010, Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2011)
  
  - beliefs about returns to education (Jensen 2010); beliefs about students' performance (Dizon-Ross 2019)

**Direct cost** of schooling `\((c)\)`: 

  - school uniform (Duflo et al., 2015, Evans and Ngatia 2021)
  
  - textbooks (Glewwe et al. 2009), scholarship (Kremer et al. 2009), tuition (Lucas and Mbiti 2012)
  
  - (conditional/unconditional) cash transfers literature
  
  - distance to school: school construction (Duflo 2001), bicycles (Muralidharan and Prakash 2017)

**Opportunity cost** of schooling `\((w_0)\)`

  - labor market opportunities and technology (Shah and Steinberg 2017, Ashraf et al. 2020, Adukia et al. 2020)

  Does road construction affect education? Adukia et al. (2020)
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Adukia et al. (2020): group discussion

- What is the research question? Why is the paper considered a contribution?

- Theoretically, how do new road connections affect schooling?
  
- What are the data sources?
  
  - What is the unit of observation?
    
  - What are the key variables and how are they constructed?
  
- What is the empirical strategy?
  
  - What is the main estimating equation?
    
  - How does identification work? What are the sources of exogenous variation?
    
  - Should we worry about any of the identification assumptions? 

---

# Road construction in India

Background: India's national rural road construction program (PMGSY) built high quality roads to 115,000 villages across the country between 2001 and 2015.

  - These connected over 30 million rural households to nearby towns.

--

Theoretically, how do new road connections affect schooling?

--
Ambiguous impacts.

--

  - They may increase the returns to education, thus increasing education.
  
--
  
  - They may increase the opportunity cost of schooling, thus decreasing education.
  
--
  
  - They may also have important income/liquidity effects.
  
--

Adukia et al. (2020) study the impact of this program on educational outcomes.

---

# Road construction in India 

Empirical challenges: road placement is endogenous.

--

Empirical solution:

  - Exploit the timing of road completion in each village.
  
  - Exploit the program rule that caused villages above specific village population thresholds to be targeted for road construction.
  
---

# Research design 1: Difference-in-Differences  

Static TWFE and event-study TWFE:

`$$Y_{i,s,t} = \beta ROAD_{i,s,t} + \gamma_{s,t} + \eta_i + \varepsilon_{i,s,t}$$`

`$$Y_{i,s,t} = \sum_{\tau \in (-5, +5), \tau \neq 1}\zeta_{\tau}(1(t = t_{i,s}^{treatment} + \tau)) + \gamma_{s,t} + \eta_i + \varepsilon_{i,s,t}$$`

--

where 

- `\(Y_{i,s,t}\)` is the outcome variable measured in village `\(i\)` and state `\(s\)` in year `\(t\)`.

- `\(ROAD_{i,s,t}\)` is indicator fow whether the village has been connectedby a paved road by year `\(t\)`.

- `\(\gamma_{s,t}\)` is state-year fixed effects, `\(\eta_i\)` is village fixed effects.

- `\(\tau\)` is the number of years before or after road construction in the village.

- Error term `\(\varepsilon_{i,s,t}\)` clustered at the village level to account for serial correlation in the dependent variable.

--

What is(are) the **identifying assumption(s)** with this research design? 

--

From the recent DiD innovations, does it make sense to run a static TWFE model?

---

# DID results: static TWFE model

`$$Y_{i,s,t} = \beta ROAD_{i,s,t} + \gamma_{s,t} + \eta_i + \varepsilon_{i,s,t}$$`

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/road_table.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# DID results: event-study model

`$$Y_{i,s,t} = \sum_{\tau \in (-5, +5), \tau \neq 1}\zeta_{\tau}(1(t = t_{i,s}^{treatment} + \tau)) + \gamma_{s,t} + \eta_i + \varepsilon_{i,s,t}$$`

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/road1.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Research design 2: Regression Discontinuity 

Below is the description of the road construction.

--

Which **RD design** is appropriate in this setting? Why? 

--

*Under PMGSY road construction guidelines, states were instructed to first target villages with populations greater than 1,000 in the population census, and then villages with population greater than 500*

*Only some states followed these guidelines, however, and even then, states followed the guidelines to different degrees because there were often several conflicting guidelines.* 

*In states where there were few unconnected villages with populations over 1,000, they tended to use the 500-person threshold immediately.*

*In most states, construction proceeded in villages both above and below the population threshold simultaneously, but there were more villages treated above the threshold, and these were treated sooner.*

*Population above a guideline threshold is therefore an imperfect predictor of treatment status.*




---

# Fuzzy RD 

Recall that fuzzy RD can be estimated with the "first" and "second" stage IV model:

`$$D_i = \theta 1\{X_i \geq 0\} + f(X_i) + f(X_i) \times 1\{X_i \geq 0\} + \varepsilon_i$$`
`$$Y_i = \beta_{fuzzy}\hat{D}_i + f(X_i) + f(X_i)\times \hat{D}_i + \eta_i$$`

--

It is also common practice to run the "reduced form" regression:

`$$Y_i = \beta_{reduced-form}1\{X_i \geq 0\} + f(X_i) + f(X_i)\times 1\{X_i \geq 0\} + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

For an RD paper, recall the checklist:

- RD jump visualization

- Balance test 

- Bunching test 

- Robustness to choice of estimation procedure, kernel, bandwidth

---

  Do perceived returns affect education? Jensen (2010)
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Perceived returns and schooling

Background:

  - Dominican Republic: 85% completion rate for primary school (8th grade) but only 30% completion rate for high school

  - At baseline, students were asked about perceived wages for those who had completed primary school vs. those who had completed high school

    - Perceived returns were about 2% per year (or 9% increase in wages if moving from 8th grade to 12th grade)
    
--
    
Jensen (2010) conducted an RCT

  - Students at random set of schools were informed about the "true" returns (10% per year, or 40% for going from 8th grade to high school)

    - These "true" returns are obtained from a Mincerian wage regression (any problem with this?)

  - Students were found to update their beliefs.
  
---

# Perceived returns and schooling

Jensen found that **correcting beliefs increased average education by 0.2 years** of schooling (column 3).

  - But the effects are heterogeneous across wealth groups, suggesting credit constraints (columns 7 vs. 11).

# Parents' misperceptions

    &lt;img src="figures/ross1.png" style="width: 95%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

--

  - Panel A: the absolute difference between true score and baseline beliefs is 20 points.

--

  - Panel B: if parents were correct, we would expect a 45 degree line relationship, but:
  
--

    - they **overestimate low-performing** children, and **underestimate high-performing** children.

---

# Parents' misperceptions

As a result, they pick the wrong workbooks for their children.
  
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Parents' misperceptions

Dizon-Ross (2019) studies how correcting such misconceptions can influence their education investment.

--

RCT: Treatment households were provided information about their children's achievement--school report card with detailed explanation.

Many more interesting results (e.g., invest more in better performing children among siblings).
