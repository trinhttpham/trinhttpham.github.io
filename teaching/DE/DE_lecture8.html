# Roadmap
  
The statistics we've just seen highlight the persistent challenge of (urban) unemployment in many countries.

--

In today's lecture, we will explore why these patterns emerge—by examining both theoretical models and empirical evidence.

--

We will start with the Harris-Todaro model, which offers a framework to understand rural-urban migration and labor market dynamics in developing economies. 

--

We will then review recent empirical research on signaling, training, and their roles in shaping urban employment outcomes.

--

Our goal is to connect observed unemployment statistics with deeper insights from economic theory and real-world data, equipping us to analyze labor market policies with rigor and nuance.

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  The Harris-Todaro model 
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Background 

The Harris-Todaro model, developed in 1970, is a foundation economic model used to explain rural-urban migration in developing countries

- by focusing on expected income rather than just wage differentials. 

--

The model assumes migrants decide to move based on the expected urban wage:

- which accounts for both the urban wage level and the probability of finding employment in the urban sector. 

--

Migration continues as long as the expected urban wage exceeds rural income

- even if urban unemployment is high, explaining persistent migration despite visible urban job scarcity.

---

# Setup 

The economy consists of two sectors: rural (agriculture) and urban (formal manufacturing/services).

--

**Urban sector employment constraint**: The urban sector has a fixed number of formal jobs, `\(E_U\)`:

- which does not immediately adjust with labor supply increases.

--

**Urban labor supply**: The total number of workers in the urban labor market is the existing urban employment plus migrants:

`$$N_U + N_M$$` 

--

**Probability of getting a formal job**: Because urban formal jobs `\(E_U\)` are fixed, the probability that any urban worker (including a migrant) obtains a formal job is:

`$$p = \frac{E_U}{N_U + N_M}$$`

- This reflects competition for limited urban jobs.


---

# Setup 

**Expected urban wage**: Migrants evaluate the expected wage in the urban sector based on the probability `\(p\)`. 

- If formal employment is found (with probability `\(p\)`), wage is `\(w_U\)`.

- Otherwise, with probability `\((1-p)\)`, they earn informal sector wages `\(w_I\)` or zero.

`$$\text{expected urban income} = p \times w_U + (1-p)w_I$$` 

--

**Migration decision rule**: Workers migrate from rural to urban if and only if the expected urban income exceeds rural income:

`$$pw_U + (1-p)w_I &gt; w_R$$`

--

**Equilibrium**: Migration continues until workers are indifferent between staying rural or migrating:

`$$pw_U + (1-p)w_I = w_R$$`

--

Given the fixed number of formal jobs and growing urban labor supply, urban employment rate `\(u\)` is:

`$$u = 1 - p = 1 - \frac{E_U}{N_U + N_M}$$`

---

# Policy implications 

How should developing countries react to the spread of urban slums?

--

Create new jobs in the urban formal sector? 

--
Not the right solution.

--

- The policy can increase both the number of migrants and the number of unemployed.
  
--

Reduce the gap between urban and rural wages?

--

- Lower urban wage: e.g., resist excessive union power when there is too much unemployment.

--

- Push rural wage: e.g., rural development programs, land reform, better technology and institutions 

  - goal is to improve productivity in agriculture, and decentralize employment toward rural areas in order to create a thriving rural non-farm economy.

---

class: inverse 

The Harris-Todaro model explains persistent urban unemployment due to rural-urban migration and fixed formal-sector jobs.

--

However, urban labor markets also face other important frictions that influence unemployment and job matching efficiency.

--

One of the most critical frictions is informational frictions:

--

- Poor or asymmetric information about worker skills and productivity.

--

- Difficulty for firms to evaluate applicants and for workers to signal their abilities.

--

- Leads to mismatches, longer job search times, and unemployment or underemployment despite available jobs.

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Informational frictions
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Signaling 


- Job search is a big labor topic in developed countries

  - It has been recently examined in developing country settings
  
- Are frictions such as limited information a big part of the challenge?


---

# Setup 

Consider two types of workers: high productivity `\(\theta_H\)` and low productivity `\(\theta_L &lt;\theta_H\)`.

--

Probability of high type is `\(\lambda\)`, and of low type is `\(1 - \lambda\)`.

--

Firms cannot observe `\(\theta\)` directly but observe a costly signal `\(s\)` chosen by workers.

--

Cost of signaling for worker of type `\(\theta\)` is `\(c(s, \theta)\)`, decreasing in productivity:

`$$c(s, \theta_H) &lt; c(s, \theta_L) \quad \forall s &gt; 0$$`

- e.g., education is less costly for high-productivity workers.

---

# Setup 

Model timing:

- Worker chooses signal level `\(s \geq 0\)`

- Firms observe `\(s\)` and form beliefs about worker productivity.

- Firms offer wage `\(w(s)\)`, based on expected productivity conditional on `\(s\)`.

- Worker receives wage and pays signaling cost.

--

Firms' expected wage:

`$$w(s) = E[\theta|s] = P_H(s)\theta_H + (1-P_H(s))\theta_L$$`
where `\(P_H(s)\)` is the probability worker is high type given `\(s\)`.

--

Workers' utility: `\(U(s,\theta) = w(s) - c(s, \theta)\)`

Workers maximize utility by choosing `\(s\)`.

---

# Equilibirum 

Separating equilibrium conditions:

- High-productivity workers choose `\(s = s_H &gt;0\)`

- Low-productivity workers choose `\(s = 0\)` (no signal).

- Firms infer that `\(s = s_H\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` high type, and `\(s = 0\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` low type.

--

Thus,

- For high type:

`$$U(s_H, \theta_H) \geq U(0, \theta_H) \Rightarrow w(s_H) - c(s_H, \theta_H) \geq w(0)$$`

- For low type:
`$$U(0, \theta_L) \geq U(s_H, \theta_L) \Rightarrow w(0) \geq w(s_H) - c(s_H, \theta_L)$$`

--

These are  incentive comparability constraints ensuring truthful signaling.

---

# Intuition for Urban Labor Markets

Only high-productivity workers find it worthwhile to pay the signaling cost.

--

Firms reward signals, allowing better screening despite imperfect information.

--

Informational frictions generate wage differentials and can exclude low-productivity workers from higher-paying jobs, causing inefficiencies and unemployment.

--

This model provides a theoretical foundation on how information asymmetries and costly signaling mechanisms shape worker-firm matching and wage determination in urban labor markets.

--

But how do these signaling strategies play out in real-world developing country contexts, especially urban labor markets characterized by informational frictions?

--

Carranza et al. (2022, AER) investigate this empirically, analyzing how signaling through education affects job outcomes among urban workers under imperfect information.


---


# Carranza et al. (2022) 

**Job Search and Hiring with Limited Information about Workseekers’ Skills**

--

Information frictions are likely:

  - Young workseekers have no work experience.

  - Workseekers report grades, but grades are weakly correlated with skills.
  
--
    
Wrong hires are costly to firms

  - Reservation and legal minimum wages exist: high compliance in the formal sector.
  
  - Employment rates are low, especially for youths.

--

Carranza et al. (2022) conducted RCTs to study how to credibly signal jobseekers' skills.


---

# The intervention

**Treatment 1**: Workseekers receive **job search counseling, obtain skill assessment and receive World Bank branded certificate** 

- To give credible signaling that workseekers can easily share with prospective employers

--

**Treatment 2**: Similar to (1) but workseekers receive **private unbranded certificate**

  - To see if people are learning information about themselves (as opposed to signaling)

--

**Treatment 3**: Run an **audit experiment, creating job applications with and without certificate**

  - To test if employer-side limited information

--

**Control**: Workseekers receive job search counseling but do not obtain any certificate

---

# Public certificate

 &lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="figures/jobsignal1.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;  

---

# Private certificate

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="figures/jobsignal2.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;  


---

# Results 

Public certificate has positive impacts on labor market outcomes

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="figures/jobsignal3.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;  
  

---

# Results 

More information improves the value of firm-worker matches


&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/jobsignal4.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
  

---

# Results 

- If more information only increases job-finding rates, we would have observed 

  - large and positive treatment effects from 66-71 percentiles where the marginally employed workseekers went from zero to positive but low earnings, 
  
  - and zero for all other percentiles.


---

# Results 

Private versus public certificate: own assessment

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/jobsignal5.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/jobsignal7.png" style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

class: inverse 

- The treatment effects of the public and private certification interventions are evidence that both firms and workseekers face limited information 

  - and that providing more information leads to quantitatively important improvements in labor market outcomes
  
--

- These might reflect both firm- and worker-side learning

--

- To directly test if there exists limited information from the firm side, they run an audit experiment


---

# Audit study

What is an audit study?

--

- Often used to investigate discrimination or other hidden behaviors by simulating a situation in which we can control for all observable factors except the characteristics of interest

--

- Involved sending out "test" individuals ("auditor") with similar characteristics but varying only the variable of interest

--

Some examples:

  - Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) compare employers' responses to similar fake resumes with blacker-sounding and whiter-sounding first names to study racial discrimination
  

---

# Carranza et al. (2022)'s audit study

They invite candidates to send them resume, they then forward resume on behalf of candidates to prospective employers

--

Three-stage randomization:

  - Generate multiple applications per candidate, randomly assign half to treatment (public certificate) and half to control (no certificate)
    
  - Randomize vacancies to receive either one or three applications with certificates
    
  - Randomly match applications to vacancies, subject to the target number of treated and control applications and constraint that no candidate's application is sent to the same vacancy more than once
  
  
---

# Audit study: Results

More informative applications lead to higher callback and interview invitation rates in a *low-information* environment
