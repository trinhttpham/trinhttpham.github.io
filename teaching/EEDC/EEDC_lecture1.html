# Opening Activity

.pull-left[
### Before we begin...

Think of an **environmental problem** from your home country.

Take 2 minutes to write down:

1. What is the problem?

2. Who is affected?

3. Why hasn't it been solved?

# What did you notice?

.center[
### Let's hear 3-4 examples
]

&lt;br&gt;

As you listen to your classmates, think about:

--

- Are these problems **technical**? (We don't know how to fix them)

--

- Are they **political**? (We can't agree on what to do)

--

- Are they **economic**? (The incentives are misaligned)

--

# What is economics?

.center[
## Economics is the study of **choices** under **scarcity**.
]

&lt;br&gt;

--

Resources are limited. Wants are not.

--

Every choice involves **trade-offs**.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:** 

- Time spent studying vs. time relaxing

--

- Money spent on healthcare vs. infrastructure

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Economics gives us tools to analyze these trade-offs systematically.**

# What is environmental economics?

.center[
## Applying economics to the **environment as a scarce resource**
]

&lt;br&gt;

--

Environmental economics helps us understand:

--

- Why do we pollute even when we know it's harmful?

--

- What policies can change behavior?

--

- How do we value things that have no market price?

--

  - Clean air, biodiversity, stable climate

---

# A puzzle to consider

.center[
### Why is coal still a major energy source in many countries, despite causing air pollution and climate change?
]

--

&lt;br&gt; 

Think about this from **different perspectives**:

--

- **Power company** 
--
→ Coal is cheap and reliable

--

- **Households** 
--
→ Need affordable electricity

--

- **Nearby residents** 
--
→ Suffer health impacts

--

- **Future generations** 
--
→ Bear climate costs

# Today's plan

We need some economic tools before diving into environmental topics.

### Today we'll cover:

1. **Markets** — What are they? How do they work?

2. **Supply and demand** — The basic framework

3. **Equilibrium and surplus** — Measuring "how well" markets work

4. **Market efficiency** — When do markets work well?

5. **Market failures** — When do they fail? (Preview of next week)

# Markets

---

# What is a market?

--

A **market** is any arrangement where buyers and sellers interact to exchange goods or services.

--

.pull-left[
### Examples

- Grocery store
- Stock exchange
- Coupang / online shopping
- Labor market (jobs)
- Farmers selling rice

]

--

.pull-right[
### Key features

- Buyers (demand)
- Sellers (supply)
- A price that coordinates them
- Voluntary exchange

--
&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
Markets are **decentralized** — no one is in charge, yet coordination happens.
]

---

# A simple example: Coffee

Imagine a small town with coffee buyers and coffee sellers.

--

**Buyers** (consumers):
- Each person has a maximum price they're willing to pay
- This depends on how much they value coffee

--

**Sellers** (producers):
- Each seller has a minimum price they need to cover costs
- This depends on their cost of production

--

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
**Question:** How do they figure out the price and quantity?

# Demand

---

# The demand curve

The **demand curve** shows how much buyers want to purchase at each price.

# The demand curve

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/Slide3.PNG" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


.center[
**Key insight:** As price goes up, quantity demanded goes down.
]


---

# Reading the demand curve

- **Horizontal:** At a price of $2, buyers want 800 cups.

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/Slide4.PNG" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- **Vertical:** If we're selling 800 cups, the last buyer is willing to pay up to $2.
  - The vertical reading tells us the **marginal willingness to pay** — how much the next buyer values the good.


---

# Why does demand slope downward?

**As price increases, quantity demanded decreases. Why?**

--

### 1. Substitution effect

- When coffee gets expensive, people switch to tea
- Alternatives become relatively more attractive

--

### 2. Income effect

- Higher prices mean your money buys less
- You can't afford as much

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Intuition:** Higher price → fewer people willing to buy → lower quantity demanded
]


---

# Quick check

.center[
#### If the price of gasoline doubles, what happens to quantity demanded?
]

&lt;br&gt;

--

.pull-left[
**It decreases because:**

- People drive less
- People carpool more
- People switch to public transit
- People buy more fuel-efficient cars (long run)
]

--

.pull-right[
**But by how much?**

This depends on **elasticity** — how responsive buyers are to price changes.

- Necessities (inelastic): small response
- Luxuries (elastic): large response
]



---

# Supply

---

# The supply curve

The **supply curve** shows how much sellers want to produce at each price.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/Slide5.PNG" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

.center[
**Key insight:** As price goes up, quantity supplied goes up.
]

---

# Reading the supply curve

- **Horizontal:** At a price of $2, sellers supply 1867 cups.

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/Slide5.PNG" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- **Vertical:** If we're producing 1867 cups, the last cup costs $2 to make.
  - The vertical reading tells us the **marginal cost** — the cost of producing one more unit.

---

# Why does supply slope upward?

**As price increases, quantity supplied increases. Why?**

--

### 1. Higher prices attract more sellers

- At low prices, only efficient producers participate
- Higher prices make it worthwhile for more sellers to enter

--

### 2. Marginal cost rises with quantity

- First units are cheap to produce (best resources, easiest methods)
- Later units are more expensive (have to use less efficient methods)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[

# Equilibrium

---

# Market equilibrium

**Equilibrium** is where supply meets demand — the price where buyers and sellers agree.

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/drought2.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


--

- **Price increases** (rice becomes scarce). **Quantity decreases** (less rice available)

--
- **Who is hit hardest?**

# Surplus and Efficiency

---

# Measuring benefits: Consumer surplus

**Consumer surplus** = What you're willing to pay − What you actually pay

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/Slide14.PNG" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

On the graph, consumer surplus is the **area below the demand curve and above the price**.


---

# Measuring benefits: Producer surplus

**Producer surplus** = What you receive − Your cost of production

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/Slide15.PNG" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

On the graph, producer surplus is the **area above the supply curve and below the price**.

# Total surplus

**Total surplus** = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"&gt;

--

**Surplus tells us whether a market is working well.**

### Efficient market

- Maximizes total surplus
- All mutually beneficial trades happen
- No way to make someone better off without making someone else worse off
]

--

# When Do Markets Work Well?

---

# The efficiency of competitive markets

Under certain conditions, competitive markets are **efficient**.

--

This is a powerful result: millions of people making individual decisions, and the outcome maximizes total surplus!

--

&lt;br&gt;

### The conditions:

--

1. **Perfect competition** — many buyers and sellers, no one controls the price

--

2. **Perfect information** — everyone knows quality, prices, etc.

--

3. **Complete markets** — all costs and benefits are reflected in prices

--

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
When these hold, markets allocate resources efficiently.
]

---

# What does "efficient" mean?

Two related concepts:

--

### 1. Maximizes total surplus

The market outcome generates the largest possible total gains from trade.

--

### 2. Pareto efficient

No way to make someone better off without making someone else worse off.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** Competitive markets are often a good way to allocate scarce resources — but only when the conditions hold.

---

# When Do Markets Fail?

---

# Market failures

What happens when the conditions for efficiency **don't hold**?

--

&lt;br&gt;

### The market fails — it produces too much or too little of something.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**For environmental economics, the most important failures are:**

--

1. **Externalities** — costs or benefits that affect third parties

--

2. **Public goods** — goods that are non-rival and non-excludable

--

3. **Incomplete information** — people don't know the true costs/benefits

---

# Externalities: A preview

An **externality** is when a transaction affects someone who isn't part of it.

--

.pull-left[
### Negative externality
- A factory pollutes → nearby residents get sick.
- The factory doesn't pay for the health costs.
- **Result:** Too much pollution.

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/coal.jpg" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[
### Positive externality
- You get vaccinated → **others** less likely to get sick.
- You bear the cost, community shares the benefit.
- **Result:** Without subsidies or mandates, vaccination rates are **too low**


&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"&gt;

**This is the core of environmental economics — we'll study this in depth next week.**
]



---

# Public goods: A preview

A **public good** is:

--

- **Non-rival**: One person's use doesn't reduce availability for others

--

- **Non-excludable**: Can't prevent people from using it

--

&lt;br&gt;

| | Excludable | Non-excludable |
|---|---|---|
| **Rival** | Private goods (food) | Common resources (fishery) |
| **Non-rival** | Club goods (Netflix) | Public goods (clean air) |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
**Problem:** If you can't exclude non-payers, who will pay? → Underprovision
]

---

# Why markets fail for the environment

Most environmental goods have **no market price**.

--

- There's no price for clean air

--

- There's no price for a stable climate

--

- There's no price for biodiversity

--

&lt;br&gt;

When something has no price, markets ignore it.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**The core problem:** Private costs ≠ Social costs

This is what we'll study for the rest of the semester.

# Summary: What we covered today

--

### 1. Markets

Buyers and sellers interact; prices coordinate them

--

### 2. Supply and demand

Demand slopes down, supply slopes up; equilibrium where they meet

--

### 3. Surplus

Consumer + producer surplus measures gains from trade

--

### 4. Efficiency

Competitive markets maximize surplus under certain conditions

--

### 5. Market failures

Externalities and public goods → markets produce wrong quantities

---

# Looking ahead

### Next week: Market Failures

We'll go deeper into:

- **Externalities** — why pollution happens, how to measure it
- **Public goods** — the free-rider problem
- **The Coase Theorem** — can private bargaining solve externalities?

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Reading for next week

- **KO Chapter 5** (Externalities and Public Goods)
- **KO Chapter 8, pp. 140–142** (Coase Theorem)

---

# Before you go
