**This Week:** How do we measure the value of things that aren't bought and sold?
]

---

# Why valuation matters

Recall from Week 3: To design good policies, we need to compare **costs** and **benefits**.

--


**Some benefits are easy to measure:**

- Revenue from timber sales
- Savings from reduced fuel use
- Medical costs avoided

--

**But many environmental benefits are not traded in markets:**

- Clean air
- Biodiversity
- Beautiful landscapes
- Stable climate

--

.content-box-yellow[
**The problem:** If we can't measure these benefits, they often get valued at **zero** in policy decisions.
]

---

# A concrete example

**Policy question:** Should Kenya subsidize energy-efficient cookstoves?

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Costs (easy to measure):**

- Stove manufacturing cost
- Subsidy cost to government
- Distribution costs
]

--

.pull-right[
**Benefits (harder to measure):**

- Reduced charcoal spending
- Less indoor air pollution → better health
- Less deforestation → climate benefits
- Time saved cooking
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
To answer this, we need to know: **How much do households value these stoves?**

This is called **willingness to pay (WTP)**.
]

---

# Two approaches to measuring WTP

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table style="width: 90%; margin: 20px auto; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; font-size: 0.95em;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr style="background: #f5f5f5;"&gt;
&lt;th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Revealed Preference&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Stated Preference&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Watch what people &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Ask what people &lt;strong&gt;would pay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Actual market behavior&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Survey responses&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Hedonic pricing, travel cost&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Contingent valuation, choice experiments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
Both have strengths and weaknesses. Let's look at each.
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Revealed Preference Methods

"Watch what people do"

---

# Revealed preference: The intuition

People's **choices** reveal how much they value things.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example: How much do people value clean air?**

--

We can't observe people buying "clean air" directly.

--

But we can observe people paying **more for houses** in less polluted areas.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key idea:** Environmental quality is "bundled" with other goods (houses, vacations). 

We can use market prices for those goods to infer the value of environmental quality.
]

---

# Hedonic pricing method

**Hedonic pricing** uses regression to isolate the environmental component of a good's price.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:** Two identical houses, except one is near a polluted factory.

- House A (clean area): $300,000
- House B (polluted area): $250,000

--

The $50,000 difference reflects the value of clean air (all else equal).

--

&lt;br&gt;

**But "all else" is rarely equal.** Houses differ in many ways:

- Size, age, number of rooms
- School quality, crime rates
- Distance to city center

---

# Hedonic pricing: Using regression

This is where **regression** (Week 4) comes in.

--

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\text{House Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Pollution} + \beta_2 \text{Rooms} + \beta_3 \text{Size} + \beta_4 \text{Crime} + \beta_5 \text{Schools} + \varepsilon$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

The coefficient `\(\beta_1\)` tells us: 

&gt; "Holding all else constant, how much less are people willing to pay for a house when pollution increases by one unit?"

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This is why we learned about regression in Week 4** — it lets us "control for" other factors to isolate the effect of environmental quality.
]

---

# Hedonic pricing: A caution

Recall from Week 4: Regression only controls for **measured** variables.

--

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\text{House Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Pollution} + \beta_2 \text{Rooms} + \beta_3 \text{Size} + \beta_4 \text{Crime} + \beta_5 \text{Schools} + \varepsilon$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

**What if something affects both pollution AND house prices, but we can't measure it?**

- Neighborhood "desirability" 
- Future development plans
- Historical discrimination in housing markets

--


.content-box-yellow[
**The coefficient `\(\beta_1\)` may be biased.** 

Hedonic pricing shows correlation, but not necessarily the causal effect of pollution on prices.
]


---

# Travel cost method

**Travel cost** infers the value of a recreational site from how much people spend to visit it.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:** How much is a national park worth?

--

People don't pay the "true" value of the park — just the entrance fee.

--

But they also spend money on:
- Transportation (gas, flights)
- Time (opportunity cost)
- Accommodation

--

&lt;br&gt;

People who travel farther reveal higher WTP for the park.

By analyzing visitation patterns, we can construct a **demand curve** for the park.

---

# Revealed preference: Limitations

--

**1. Need observable behavior**

- Can only value things people actually choose
- Can't value things that don't exist yet (e.g., new park, future policy)

--

**2. Hard to isolate preferences**

- Many factors affect choices simultaneously
- Need lots of data and careful controls

--

**3. Only captures "use value"**

- Hedonic: Only people who live near the amenity
- Travel cost: Only people who visit
- Doesn't capture value from people who never visit but still care

--

.content-box-yellow[
**What if we want to value something that isn't reflected in market behavior?**
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Stated Preference Methods

"Ask what people would pay"

---

# Stated preference: The intuition

If we can't observe what people do, we can **ask** them.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Contingent valuation:** Create a hypothetical market and ask people their WTP.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example questions:**

&gt; "What is the maximum you would pay per month for a 50% reduction in air pollution?"

--

&gt; "Would you pay $20/month for cleaner air in your neighborhood?"

--

&lt;br&gt;

This can value things that don't exist yet or have no market.

---

# Stated preference: The problem

**People may not tell the truth.**

--

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table style="width: 95%; margin: 20px auto; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left; font-size: 0.9em;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr style="background: #f5f5f5;"&gt;
&lt;th style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Bias&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Overstate WTP to influence policy; understate to avoid paying&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothetical bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Easy to say "yes" when you don't actually have to pay&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Respondents unfamiliar with what they're valuing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting-point bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Responses anchored by suggested amounts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

✓ Based on real choices

✗ Need observable behavior

✗ Can't value hypotheticals

]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# The BDM Method

A solution that combines stated preferences with real incentives

---

# BDM: Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method

**The idea:** Create a real market where telling the truth is the best strategy.

--

**How it works:**

1. Ask the respondent: "What is the maximum you would pay for this stove?"

--

2. Draw a random price from a predetermined range (unknown to respondent)

--

3. **If WTP ≥ random price:** Respondent buys at the random price

--

4. **If WTP &lt; random price:** No sale

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** The respondent's stated WTP determines *whether* they buy, but not *what price* they pay. 
- So there's no benefit to lying.
]

---

# Why is BDM "incentive compatible"?

**What if you overstate your WTP?**

--

- Say you'd pay $50, but you really value it at just $30

--
- Random price drawn: $40

--
- You have to buy at $40 — but it's only worth $30 to you

--
- **You lose $10**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**What if you understate your WTP?**

--
- Say you'd pay $20, but you really value it at $30

--
- Random price drawn: $25

--
- You don't get to buy — even though you would have gained

--
- **You miss out on $5 of value**

--

.content-box-green[
**Best strategy:** State your true WTP. Then you buy if and only if the price is below your true value.
]

---

# BDM: Two purposes

The BDM mechanism serves **two purposes**:

--

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Incentive-compatible WTP elicitation**

Because the price is fixed *before* you state your WTP, it's in your best interest to tell the truth.

--

**2. Random assignment for causal inference**

Because the prices are randomly drawn, adoption is random (conditional on WTP).

This allows researchers to estimate the **causal effect** of adoption — just like an RCT!

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
BDM creates randomization, which allows causal inference.

# Group Activity: Berkouwer &amp; Dean (2022)

[See This Blog Post for Berkouwer and Dean (2022)](https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2019/10/21/closing-the-energy-efficiency-gap-for-low-income-households/)

**Instructions:** Discuss in groups of 3-4 (10 minutes). Be prepared to share.

&lt;br&gt;

**1.** What is the main research question?

**2.** Why did the researchers use BDM instead of just asking "What would you pay?"

**4.** What did they find about WTP compared to market price?

**5.** Why might WTP be so low, even though the stoves save money?

# Application: Cookstoves in Kenya

Berkouwer &amp; Dean (2022)

---

# Context: Cooking in Kenya

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**The problem:**

- 67% of Kenyan households use biomass (wood, charcoal) for cooking

- Traditional stoves are inefficient

- Consequences:
  - Indoor air pollution → health problems
  - High fuel costs for poor households
  - Deforestation → climate change
]

# The energy-efficient alternative

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Jikokoa stove:**

- Uses 39% less charcoal than traditional jiko

- Less smoke → better health

- Saves money on fuel over time

- But costs ~$40 (about 1 week's income for many households)

&lt;br&gt;

**Policy question:** Should the government subsidize these stoves?

# Research questions

&lt;br&gt;

[Berkouwer &amp; Dean (2022)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20210766) ask:

&lt;br&gt;

**1. What is households' willingness to pay for the efficient stove?**

- Is WTP higher or lower than the market price?
- How much subsidy would be needed for widespread adoption?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**2. What is the causal effect of stove adoption on charcoal spending?**

- Do households actually save money?
- How much?

---

# Study design

**Sample:** 1,000 households in Nairobi, Kenya

--

**Method:** BDM mechanism to elicit WTP

- **Step 1:** Surveyor shows the stove, explains benefits

- **Step 2:** Ask: "What is the maximum you would pay?"

- **Step 3:** Respondent draws a random price from a bag

- **Step 4:** If WTP ≥ price drawn → purchase at that price

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
Prices ranged from 0 to 500 Kenyan shillings (market price ~$40 = 4,000 KSh)
]


---

# Key findings on WTP

.pull-left[

**1. Average WTP is well below market price**

- Mean WTP: ~800 KSh ($8)
- Market price: ~4,000 KSh ($40)


**2. Very few would buy at market price**

- Only ~5% of households have WTP ≥ market price


**3. Demand is highly price-sensitive**

- At 50% subsidy: ~25% would adopt
- At 75% subsidy: ~60% would adopt
]

.pull-right[
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/wtp.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Policy implication:** Without subsidies, adoption will remain very low — even though the stoves save money over time.
]

---

# Why is WTP so low?

The stoves **pay for themselves** in fuel savings within a few months.

So why don't households want to buy them?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Possible explanations:**

1. **Credit constraints** — Can't afford $40 upfront, even if it saves money later

2. **Present bias** — Value today's money more than future savings

3. **Uncertainty** — Not sure the savings will materialize

4. **Inattention** — Don't fully process the savings calculation

--

&lt;br&gt;

Berkouwer &amp; Dean test these explanations (especially credit constraints) using their experimental design.


---

# Credit constraints matter

.pull-left[

**When households can pay in installments (credit), WTP increases significantly.**

- Gray line: Must pay full price upfront → lower WTP
- Blue/Orange lines: Can pay weekly or monthly → higher WTP

]

.pull-right[
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/wtp2.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

--

.content-box-green[
**Implication:** Low WTP isn't just about low valuation — many households *want* the stove but **can't afford** the upfront cost. Credit access could increase adoption without subsidies.
]


---

# Causal effect of adoption on charcoal spending

**Recall:** BDM creates random assignment (conditional on WTP).

--

Among households with the same WTP, some randomly got low prices (adopted) and others got high prices (didn't adopt).

--

&lt;br&gt;

**This allows causal inference:**

Comparing adopters vs. non-adopters with similar WTP → effect of adoption

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Finding:** Households that adopted the stove reduced charcoal spending by **~40%**.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
The randomization from BDM lets us make causal claims, just like the Gujarat RCT.
]

---

# Summary: Why this study matters

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Methodological innovation**

- BDM provides incentive-compatible WTP estimates
- Also creates random assignment for causal inference

--

**2. Policy-relevant findings**

- WTP is far below market price → subsidies needed
- But stoves do save money → subsidies are cost-effective

--

**3. Broader implications**

- Many "beneficial" technologies have low adoption
- Understanding WTP helps design better policies
- Credit constraints may be a key barrier
