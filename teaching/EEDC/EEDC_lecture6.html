# Why Conservation?

---

# The externality problem

Why do private landowners deforest?

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Private benefits of deforestation:**

- Timber sales
- Agricultural land
- Charcoal production
- Immediate income
]

--

.pull-right[
**Social benefits of forests (not captured privately):**

- Carbon storage → climate stability
- Biodiversity habitat
- Watershed protection
- Air quality
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This is a classic externality problem** (Week 2): Private landowners don't account for the social benefits of forests, so they deforest "too much" from society's perspective.
]

---

# The scale of the problem

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Global deforestation:**

- ~10 million hectares lost per year
- Tropical forests most affected
- Accounts for ~10% of global CO₂ emissions

**Developing countries bear the burden:**

- 95% of deforestation occurs in tropics
- Often driven by poverty and weak institutions
]

]

# What should governments do?

Recall from Week 3: Two main policy approaches to correct externalities

--

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Command-and-control**

- Ban or restrict deforestation
- Fines and penalties for violations

--

**2. Market-based instruments**

- **Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES):** Pay landowners to conserve
- This is like a **subsidy for a positive externality** (the mirror image of a pollution tax)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** PES treats conservation as a service that landowners provide to society — and compensates them for it.

# Challenges to Conservation

---

# Challenge 1: Poverty and conservation

Poverty and conservation are deeply intertwined.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The tension:**

- Poor communities often rely directly on natural resources for survival
  - Deforestation for fuel wood
  - Clearing land for subsistence agriculture
  - Overfishing for food and income

--

- Strict conservation rules can push poor households deeper into poverty

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Our goal:** Protect the environment without further impoverishing the poor.
]

---

# Challenge 2: Political economy

Political factors can undermine conservation efforts:

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Government priorities:**

- Economic growth (mining, logging, agriculture) vs. conservation
- Budget constraints → underfunded enforcement

--

**Corruption:**

- Illegal logging, poaching, land grabbing
- Weak enforcement of environmental regulations

--

**International pressures:**

- Trade agreements can help (deforestation-free supply chains)
- Or hurt (demand for commodities drives deforestation)

--

Let's look at **Indonesia** as a case study of political economy and deforestation.

---

# Indonesia: Decentralization and deforestation

**Context:**

- Indonesia has the third-largest tropical forest in the world
- Rapid deforestation driven by palm oil, timber, mining

--

**The governance structure:**

- National government sets forest rules
- But relies on **local officials** for enforcement
- After decentralization (1998), district heads gained significant power

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Burgess et al. (2012)** ask: How does the number of local governments affect deforestation?

---

# The "permit selling" model

Think of illegal deforestation permits as a market:

--

**If there's ONE district head** (monopolist):

- Charges high "price" for permits
- Fewer permits sold
- Less deforestation

--

**If there are MULTIPLE district heads** (competition):

- Each competes for bribes
- Charge lower "prices"
- More permits sold
- More deforestation

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Counterintuitive:** More local governments → more deforestation (because of competition in corruption)
]

---

# Burgess et al. (2012): Testing the theory

**Natural experiment:** Indonesia split many districts between 1998-2008

- From 292 districts (1998) to 483 (2008)

--

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken_splitting.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Results: More districts → More deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken1.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Results: More districts → More deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken2.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Results: More districts → More deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken3.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Results: More districts → More deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken4.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Results: More districts → More deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken5.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Results: More districts → More deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/olken6.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


--

&lt;br&gt;

When a forest area is split across more districts, deforestation increases — consistent with "competition in corruption."

---

# Indonesia: Political cycles and deforestation

**Balboni et al. (2021)** ask: Does deforestation vary with election cycles?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The theory:**

- Before elections: Politicians need campaign funds → allow more deforestation (for bribes)
- During elections: Voters dislike deforestation (forest fires, haze) → less deforestation
- After elections: "Pay back" supporters → spike in deforestation

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The setting:**

- Indonesian district heads serve 5-year terms
- Different districts have elections at different times
- Allows comparison across districts at different points in their electoral cycle

---

# Results: Clear electoral cycle in deforestation

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/election_cycle.png" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.small[
- **X-axis:** Time relative to election year (t = election, t+1 = year after, t-1 = year before)
- **Y-axis:** Forest fires/burning relative to average
]

--

**The pattern:**
- High deforestation **after elections** (payback to supporters)
- Sharp drop **during election year** (voters dislike forest fires)
- Rises again **before next election** (need campaign funds)

---

# Lessons from Indonesia

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Institutions matter**

- Decentralization can undermine conservation if it creates "competition in corruption"

--

**2. Politics matter**

- Deforestation follows electoral cycles
- Politicians respond to voter preferences — but also to need for campaign funds

--

**3. De jure ≠ de facto**

- National laws exist, but local enforcement determines actual outcomes

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Implication:** Conservation policies must account for political economy realities, not just economic incentives.

# Conservation Approaches

---

# Approach 1: Command-and-control

**Objective:** Increase the private cost of environmental degradation

--

.pull-left[
**Example: Brazil's Forest Code**

- Landowners in Amazon must maintain 80% native forest
- Violations → heavy fines, land confiscation, imprisonment
- Makes illegal deforestation more expensive than compliance
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="figures/amazon.png" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
]

---

# Command-and-control: More examples

**Objective:** Increase the private cost of environmental degradation

**Indonesia's timber certification (SVLK):**

- Companies must prove legal sourcing
- Non-compliance → can't sell to EU markets
- Uses market access as enforcement lever

--

&lt;br&gt;

**California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act:**

- Mandates cuts in water usage
- Forces farms to switch crops or stop farming
- Conservation through regulation

---

# Problems with command-and-control

--

**1. Gap between de jure and de facto**

- Laws exist on paper, but enforcement is weak
- Political economy factors (corruption, budget constraints)

--

**2. May harm the poor**

- Banning deforestation can take away livelihoods
- Poor households may have no alternatives

--

**3. No flexibility**

- Same rules for everyone, regardless of costs
- Recall from Week 3: Not cost-effective

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Alternative approach:** Instead of punishing environmental harm, **reward conservation**.
]

---

# Approach 2: Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)

**PES:** Financial rewards for engaging in environmentally beneficial actions

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzNWnREZ2xI?si=elI9Qse5QClAPJ4s&amp;amp;start=8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key features:**

- **Voluntary participation** — If payment doesn't cover costs, people can opt out
- **Conditionality** — Payment only if conservation actions are verified
- **Focus on environment** — Not primarily a poverty program (but aims not to worsen poverty)

---

# Why PES might not work

--

**1. Additionality problem**

- Many participants would have conserved anyway
- Paying them doesn't create new conservation
- "Paying people not to do what they weren't going to do"

--

**2. Leakage**

- Conservation in one area may shift deforestation elsewhere
- Net effect could be zero

--

**3. Monitoring challenges**

- How do you verify compliance?
- Especially in remote forest areas

--

&lt;br&gt;

**These are empirical questions — we need RCTs to answer them!**

# Group Activity: Jayachandran et al. (2017)

**Instructions:** Discuss in groups of 3-4 (10 minutes). Be prepared to share.

&lt;br&gt;

**1.** What is the research question?

**2.** How did they randomize? What is treatment vs. control?

**3.** What was the payment amount? How does it compare to the value of the land?

**4.** What did they find about deforestation rates?

**5.** How did they calculate the cost-effectiveness of the program?

**6.** Why might some participants have conserved even without payment? Is this a problem?

# Evidence: PES in Uganda

Jayachandran et al. (2017)

---

# Context: Deforestation in Uganda

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**The problem:**

- Forests cover 1/8 of Uganda's land
- Deforestation rate: 2.7% per year (2005-2010)
- Third highest in the world

**Main drivers:**

- Subsistence agriculture
- Domestic demand for timber and charcoal

]

---

# The PES program

**Randomized controlled trial** in 121 villages in Western Uganda

--

**Design:**: 60 treatment villages offered PES + 61 control villages: no program

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/jaya_pes1.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

# Program details

&lt;br&gt;

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Duration | 2 years (2011-2013) |
| Implementer | NGO (Chimp Trust) |
| Eligibility | Households owning primary forest |
| Payment | 70,000 UGX (~$28) per hectare per year |
| Typical earnings | ~$56/year (for 2 hectares) |
| Monitoring | Boots-on-the-ground by Chimp Trust |
| Condition | Must enroll all your forest; non-compliance → ineligible |

# Main outcome: Tree cover from satellite imagery

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/jaya_pes2.png" style="width: 65%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Results: PES cut deforestation by more than half

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/jaya_pes3.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- Control villages: Lost ~9% of forest area
- Treatment villages: Lost ~4% of forest area
- **PES reduced deforestation by more than half**

---

# Cost-benefit analysis

**Valuing the CO₂ benefits:**

--

Hectares saved → Tons of CO₂ delayed → Social value

--

&lt;br&gt;

| Step | Value |
|------|-------|
| Tree cover saved | 5.5 hectares per village |
| CO₂ delayed | ~3,000 metric tons per village |
| Social value per ton | $1.11 |
| Program cost per ton | $0.46 |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Benefit-cost ratio: 2.4**

This is much higher than most US government carbon policies (which often have B-C ratio &lt; 1)

---

# Does PES reduce poverty?

A "win-win" is often claimed: environmental protection AND poverty reduction

--

**But there's double-counting:**

- Some of the payment compensates for compliance costs
- Only the remainder is a "pure transfer" that improves wellbeing

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Jayachandran (2023) notes an inherent trade-off:**

&gt; "The more successful PES is at environmental conservation, the less so it is at increasing economic well-being."

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**PES is not primarily an anti-poverty program.** Its goal is conservation. 

- The "win" is that it doesn't *worsen* poverty (unlike bans).
]

---

# The additionality problem

**Who are the PES participants?**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Three types:**

1. **Cost &gt; Payment:** Won't participate (payment too low)

2. **Cost ≤ 0:** Would conserve anyway → Full payment is "pure transfer"

3. **0 &lt; Cost ≤ Payment:** Conserve *because of* PES → This is where additionality comes from

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The challenge:**

- We can't observe individual costs
- So we pay everyone the same amount
- Some get more than needed; others won't participate

---
---

# Can we improve PES design?

**The Uganda program paid everyone who enrolled.**

--

But there's a problem: Landowners can **choose which parcels to enroll**.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**What happens?**

- Enroll parcels they were going to conserve anyway (low risk)
- Leave out parcels they plan to deforest (high risk)
- PES pays for conservation that would have happened anyway

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This reduces additionality and cost-effectiveness.**

# Improving PES Design: Mexico

Izquierdo-Tort, Jayachandran &amp; Saavedra (2024)

---

# Mexico's national PES program

**Context:**

- Mexico has run a national PES program (PSA) since 2003
- Pays forest owners to conserve
- Over 7 million hectares enrolled

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The problem with the standard contract:**

- Landowners choose which forest parcels to enroll
- They tend to enroll parcels they weren't going to deforest anyway
- High-risk parcels are left out → get deforested

---

# The experiment: Full enrollment vs. partial enrollment

**Study location:** Selva Lacandona, Chiapas — Mexico's largest tropical rainforest

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Randomized trial with 63 farmers:**

.pull-left[
**Standard contract (control):**

- Choose which parcels to enroll
- Can leave some forest out
- This is how PSA normally works
]

.pull-right[
**Full enrollment (treatment):**

- Must enroll ALL forest to receive payment
- Cannot cherry-pick parcels
- Aims to capture high-risk forest
]

---

# Why full enrollment should work

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**With partial enrollment:**

Landowner has 3 forest parcels:
- Parcel A: Steep, no road → low risk → **enroll**
- Parcel B: Near farm → medium risk → **enroll**
- Parcel C: Prime for clearing → high risk → **don't enroll** → deforest
]

--

.pull-right[
**With full enrollment:**

Same landowner:
- Must enroll A, B, AND C to get payment
- Parcel C is now protected
- **More additionality**
]

---

# Results: Full enrollment reduces deforestation by 41%

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**A simple contract change — requiring full enrollment — quadrupled cost-effectiveness.**
]

---

# Why does this work?

**The extra conservation comes from parcels that landowners would NOT have enrolled under the standard contract.**

--

These are exactly the high-risk parcels where PES has the most impact.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Trade-off:**

- Full enrollment had lower compliance rates (more stringent requirements)
- But the extra conservation more than offset this

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Policy implication:** Many PES programs worldwide allow partial enrollment. 

This simple design change could dramatically improve their effectiveness.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;PES works&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"&gt;Design details matter a lot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Summary: What have we learned?

--

**1. Conservation is an externality problem**

- Private landowners don't capture social benefits of forests

--

**2. Political economy matters**

- Indonesia: Decentralization and electoral cycles affect deforestation
- De jure rules ≠ de facto outcomes

--

**3. PES can work**

- Uganda RCT: Reduced deforestation by more than half
- Cost-effective compared to other carbon policies

--

**4. Design details matter**

- Mexico: Requiring full enrollment (instead of partial) quadrupled cost-effectiveness
- Simple contract changes can dramatically improve outcomes

---

# Looking ahead

**Next week: Economics of Pollution**

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Air and water pollution in developing countries
- Monitoring and enforcement challenges
- Evidence from India and China

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Connection to this week:**

- Similar themes: Externalities, political economy, policy design
- Similar methods: RCTs to evaluate policies
