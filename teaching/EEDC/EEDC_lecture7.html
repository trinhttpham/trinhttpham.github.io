# Why Is There Too Much Pollution?

---

# The economics of pollution (Review from Week 2)

**Negative production externalities:**

- Firms don't pay the full social cost of pollution
- Private marginal cost &lt; Social marginal cost
- Result: Over-production → too much pollution

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Negative consumption externalities:**

- Consumers don't pay for pollution from their choices (e.g., cars, fuel)
- Private marginal benefit &gt; Social marginal benefit
- Result: Over-consumption → too much pollution

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Public goods problem:**

- Clean air and water are non-excludable and non-rival
- Free-rider problem → under-provision of pollution control

---

# Why doesn't Coase bargaining solve it?

**Recall Coase theorem:** If property rights are well-defined and transaction costs are low, private bargaining can achieve efficient outcomes.

--

.pull-left[
**But in large-scale pollution scenarios, it rarely works:**

- Millions of polluters and victims
- High transaction costs
- Unclear property rights

# Solutions and Challenges

---

# Policy solutions (Review from Week 3)

&lt;br&gt;

**Command-and-control regulations:**

- Emission limits and technology standards
- ✓ Can achieve pollution targets
- ✗ Not cost-effective (same standard for all firms)

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Market-based policies:**

- Emission taxes (Pigouvian tax)
- Cap-and-trade systems
- ✓ Cost-effective (firms with low abatement costs reduce more)
- ✗ Can create pollution "hot spots"

---

# But implementation is harder in developing countries

&lt;br&gt;

| Challenge | Why it's worse in LMICs |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Monitoring** | Poorer technology, limited infrastructure |
| **Enforcement** | Weak contracts, limited state capacity |
| **Corruption** | Agency problems, auditor capture |
| **Political economy** | Competing priorities (growth vs. environment) |
| **Missing markets** | Credit constraints limit firm investments |

--


.content-box-yellow[
**Key insight:** The same policy that works in a high-capacity state may fail in a low-capacity one. 

**Implementation details matter.**
]

---

# Inequality and governance challenges

&lt;br&gt;

**Inequality:**

- Countries least responsible for GHG emissions are most vulnerable to climate change
- Within countries: Wealthier communities can shield themselves from pollution

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Governance:**

- Climate change will expose gaps between high- and low-capacity governments
- Need systems for adaptation, mitigation, and resilience

--

&lt;br&gt;

# Case Study 1: Third-Party Auditors in India

Duflo, Greenstone, Pande &amp; Ryan (2013)

---

# Context: Industrial pollution in Gujarat, India

&lt;br&gt;

**Gujarat:**

- One of India's fastest-growing industrial states
- 5% of India's population, but 19% of manufacturing output
- Rapid growth → severe air and water degradation
- Contains **two most polluted industrial clusters** in India
- Three of India's **five most polluted rivers**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The regulatory system:**

- National laws set standards, but **enforcement is at state level**
- Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) uses:
  - Plant-level inspections
  - **Third-party environmental audits**

---

# How third-party audits work

&lt;br&gt;

**The process:**

1. Plants are responsible for hiring and paying an auditor
2. Auditor visits plant during three seasons, takes pollution readings
3. Auditor compiles findings and submits report to GPCB

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The problem:**

- Auditors are paid by the plants they audit
- Creates a **conflict of interest**
- On paper: Safeguards and strict penalties for cheating
- In practice: ?

---

# The status quo was corrupted

Auditors consistently reported emissions **just below the legal standard** — while actual emissions were often much higher.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/audit1.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.small[Readings for Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM, mg/Nm³), Midline survey]

---

# The experiment: Reforming the audit system

**Collaboration:** Researchers + Gujarat Pollution Control Board

**Sample:** 473 high-pollution plants (mostly textile processing)
- 233 randomly assigned to treatment
- 240 in control group

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Three treatment components:**

| Component | Status Quo | Treatment |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Independence** | Plant chooses &amp; pays auditor | Random assignment, paid from central pool |
| **Monitoring** | None | 20% of reports backchecked |
| **Incentives (Year 2)** | None | Pay based on accuracy |

---

# Results: Auditors reported more truthfully

Treatment lowered the fraction of plants falsely reported as compliant.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/audit2.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.small[Negative (positive) values indicate treatment auditors are less (more) likely to report readings in that bin.]

---

# Financial incentives mattered

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/audit3.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Sharp increase in reported pollution at the start of Year 2, when accuracy-based pay was introduced.

---

# Treatment plants reduced their pollution

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/audit4.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The treatment reduced pollution most at **higher quantiles** — the worst polluters improved the most.

---

# Key takeaways from Gujarat

**1. The original system was corrupted**

- Auditors misreported to please clients who paid them

--

**2. Simple reforms improved accuracy**

- Random assignment broke the client-auditor relationship
- Backchecks created accountability
- Financial incentives reinforced truthful reporting

--

**3. Better monitoring → less pollution**

- When auditors reported truthfully, plants faced real regulatory pressure
- Plants reduced emissions to comply

--

.content-box-green[
**Policy lesson:** Audit independence and accountability can make regulation effective, even in low-capacity settings.

# Group Activity: Pollution Regulation Challenges

**Instructions:** Discuss in groups of 3-4 (10 minutes). Be prepared to share.

&lt;br&gt;

**Scenario:** You are advising a government in a rapidly industrializing country. They want to reduce industrial air pollution but have limited resources for monitoring and enforcement.

&lt;br&gt;

**Questions:**

1. What are the main challenges you would expect in implementing pollution standards?

2. Based on the Gujarat case, what design features would you recommend for an audit system?

3. How might corruption undermine your recommendations? How would you address this?

4. Would you recommend command-and-control or market-based approaches? Why?

# Case Study 2: Transportation Emissions

---

# The challenge of regulating vehicle emissions

&lt;br&gt;

**Why is this hard?**

- Millions of individual vehicles
- Emissions vary by vehicle age, maintenance, driving patterns
- Real-time measurement is very costly
- No feasible tax or bargaining solution

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Common approaches:**

1. **Driving restrictions** — Ban certain vehicles on certain days
2. **Emission standards** — Regulate new vehicles at manufacture
3. **Inspection programs** — Periodic smog checks

---

# Driving restrictions: Examples from Asia

**Do you think this policy works?**
]

---

# Driving restrictions in Mexico City: Davis (2008)

**Policy:** Ban cars one day per week based on license plate number

- Easy to enforce
- Used in many cities worldwide

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Result:** Emissions didn't drop.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Why?**

- People bought **second cars** to bypass the ban
- These were often **older, high-emission vehicles**
- Net effect: **Pollution may have increased**

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Lesson:** Behavioral responses can undermine well-intentioned policies. Need to anticipate how people will adapt.
]

---

# Emission standards for new vehicles: US evidence

**Jacobsen, Sallee, Shapiro &amp; van Benthem (2023)**

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/us1.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Standards have dramatically reduced emissions from **new** vehicles.

---

# Exhaust standards cause large decreases in emission rates

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/us5.png" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.center[Dashed vertical lines: standards change for cars only. Solid vertical lines: standards change for both cars and trucks.]

---

# But standards miss the biggest polluters

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/us6.png" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Older vehicles** account for the majority of emissions, but standards only affect new cars.

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Standards are not cost-effective** because they fail to encourage scrapping old, high-emission vehicles.
]

---

# Corruption in vehicle inspections: Oliva (2015)

**Study:** Smog check inspections in Mexico City

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Finding:**

- High correlation in test results within testing centers across different cars
- Centers used "donor cars" to produce clean results for dirty vehicles
- ~10% of tests are fraudulent for cars ≥10 years old

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Implication:**

- Even with inspection programs, corruption undermines effectiveness
- Similar to the Gujarat auditor problem
- Eliminating this loophole would be costly for vehicle owners

---

# Transportation emissions: Key lessons

&lt;br&gt;

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Driving restrictions | Behavioral response (buy second car) |
| New vehicle standards | Miss old vehicles (majority of emissions) |
| Inspection programs | Corruption/fraud |

--

&lt;br&gt;

# Case Study 3: Political Economy of Water Pollution

Lipscomb &amp; Mobarak (2016)

---

# Transboundary pollution: The problem

&lt;br&gt;

**Rivers flow downstream** — pollution in one jurisdiction affects others.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The incentive problem:**

- Upstream regions bear costs of pollution control
- Benefits flow downstream (literally)
- Regions may pollute more when their waste primarily affects downstream areas

--

&lt;br&gt;

**This is similar to Week 6 (Indonesia):**

- Decentralization can create perverse incentives
- When jurisdictions split, they stop internalizing cross-border externalities

---

# The empirical challenge

&lt;br&gt;

**Question:** Do regions pollute more when damages are "exported" downstream?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Challenge:** Omitted variable bias

- Smaller counties may have weaker enforcement
- Different counties may have different technology
- Hard to isolate the effect of boundaries

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Solution:** Study what happens when a county **splits**

- Before split: One county internalizes all pollution effects
- After split: Upstream county can "export" pollution downstream

---

# Brazil splits counties over time

Brazil split many counties over time, creating natural variation in administrative boundaries.

--
.center[
**1991 → 1998:** County A splits into **A and B** ; County D splits into **C and D**
]

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Key:** River now crosses **more borders** between the same monitoring stations → changes incentives for pollution control.
]

---

# Measuring distance upstream and downstream

**Setup:** Two water quality monitoring stations along a river, with a county boundary between them.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/brazil2.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- **Station 1:** Upstream (measures pollution entering the border segment)
- **Station 2:** Downstream (measures pollution leaving the border segment)

--

**The question:** Does pollution *increase* between Station 1 and Station 2 when they are in *different* counties?

---

# Water quality monitors in Brazil

Concentrated in southern/southeastern Brazil (more industrialized)

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/brazil3.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.center[Black dots = water quality monitoring stations; Gray lines = county boundaries (1991)]


---

# Results: More borders → More pollution

For each additional border crossed, pollution increases by 3.2%.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/brazil4.png" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why does this happen?

**Before split:**

- County government considers pollution effects on all residents
- Internalizes downstream damages
- More incentive to control pollution

--

**After split:**

- Upstream county only considers its own residents
- Downstream damages are "someone else's problem"
- Less incentive to control pollution

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This is the same logic as Indonesia (Week 6):** Decentralization can worsen environmental outcomes when externalities cross jurisdictional boundaries.
]

---

# Policy implications

**1. Jurisdiction design matters**

- Environmental problems often don't respect administrative boundaries
- Need coordination mechanisms across jurisdictions

--

**2. River basin management**

- Manage water resources at the watershed level
- Not at arbitrary political boundaries

--

**3. Intergovernmental transfers**

- Compensate downstream regions
- Or penalize upstream pollution

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** Political boundaries create economic incentives. Poor boundary design can worsen environmental outcomes.
]

# Summary: What have we learned?

--

**1. Pollution burden is highest in developing countries**

- Air pollution is the #1 risk factor for death in LMICs
- Water pollution deaths are 1000x higher than in rich countries

--

**2. Implementation challenges are severe**

- Monitoring, enforcement, corruption
- Same policy may work differently across contexts

--

**3. Design details matter**

- Gujarat: Auditor independence + incentives → truthful reporting → less pollution
- Mexico: Driving bans → behavioral adaptation → no improvement
- Brazil: County splits → more transboundary pollution

--

**4. Political economy shapes outcomes**

- Decentralization can worsen externality problems
- Need coordination across jurisdictions

---

# Looking ahead

**Next week: Climate Change**

--

&lt;br&gt;

- The ultimate global externality
- Mitigation vs. adaptation
- International cooperation challenges
- Climate policy in developing countries

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Connection to this week:**

- Climate change is the largest pollution problem
- Same challenges: Monitoring, enforcement, political economy
- But at global scale
