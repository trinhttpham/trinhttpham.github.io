# Recap from Week 8

&lt;br&gt;

**What we learned:**

- Climate change is the ultimate externality — global, long-term, unequal
- Damages fall disproportionately on poor countries
- Social Cost of Carbon provides a policy target
- Carbon pricing works but is politically difficult
- International cooperation is a collective action problem

--

&lt;br&gt;

**This week's question:**

# Mitigation vs. Adaptation

---

# Climate change mitigation vs. adaptation

&lt;br&gt;

**Mitigation:**

- Reduce emissions or increase carbon absorption
- Addresses the **cause** of climate change
- Benefits are **global** and **long-term**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Adaptation:**

- Modify systems to minimize harm from climate impacts
- Addresses the **consequences** of climate change
- Benefits are **local** and **more immediate**

---

# How do mitigation and adaptation relate?

&lt;br&gt;

**Complements:**

- Optimal policy contains **both**
- Neither alone is sufficient

--

**Substitutes:**

- More of one means less is needed of the other
- If we mitigate more → less warming → less adaptation needed
- If we adapt better → damages lower → less urgency to mitigate

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**The current trajectory suggests we will need both substantial mitigation AND adaptation.**
]

# Climate Engineering

---

# What is climate engineering?

&lt;br&gt;

**Two very different categories:**

--

**1. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)**

- Reduce concentrations of GHGs in atmosphere
- Examples: Direct air capture, ocean fertilization, reforestation

--

**2. Solar Radiation Management (SRM)**

- Cool the planet by reflecting sunlight away
- Examples: Stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**CDR addresses the root cause; SRM treats the symptoms.**

# Carbon dioxide removal: Overview

&lt;/div&gt;

.small[Source: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-noaa-state-science-factsheet]

---

# CDR: Land-based approaches

&lt;br&gt;

**Direct Air Capture (DAC):**

- Machines that capture CO₂ directly from ambient air
- Currently very expensive (~$600/ton)

--

**Nature-based solutions:**

- Reforestation/afforestation (connects to Week 6)
- Agricultural carbon sequestration (soil carbon)
- Biochar (stable carbon stored in soils)

--

**Enhanced weathering:**

- Accelerate natural rock weathering that absorbs CO₂
- Spread crusite or silicate minerals on agricultural land

---

# CDR: Ocean-based approaches

&lt;br&gt;

**Ocean alkalinity enhancement:**

- Increase ocean's capacity to absorb CO₂
- May also mitigate ocean acidification

--

**Other marine CDR:**

- Macroalgae (seaweed) cultivation and sinking
- Ocean fertilization (add nutrients to stimulate phytoplankton)
- Direct ocean removal (strip CO₂ from seawater)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**All ocean-based approaches have significant uncertainties about ecosystem impacts.**
]

---

# CDR: Benefits and risks

&lt;br&gt;

**Potential benefits:**

- Remove historical emissions (not just reduce new ones)
- Co-benefits: Improved soils, forests, reduced ocean acidification

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Concerns:**

- **Scale:** Need to remove billions of tons per year
- **Storage:** Where to safely store captured carbon for centuries?
- **Ecosystem impacts:** Marine CDR effects not fully understood
- **Cost:** Currently very expensive at scale

---

# Solar radiation management

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/sai.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.small[Source: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/solar-radiation-modification-noaa-state-science-factsheet]

---

# SRM: Main approaches

&lt;br&gt;

**Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI):**

- Inject particles (like sulfur dioxide) into stratosphere
- Mimics cooling effect of volcanic eruptions
- Could cool planet relatively quickly

--

**Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB):**

- Spray sea salt into low-level clouds
- Makes clouds more reflective
- Regional application possible

---

# SRM: Major concerns

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Does not address root cause:**

- CO₂ still accumulates → ocean acidification continues
- If stopped suddenly → rapid "rebound" warming

--

**2. Uneven impacts:**

- Some regions may benefit, others may be harmed
- Changes to precipitation patterns, monsoons

--

**3. Governance:**

- Who decides to deploy?
- No international governance framework
- "Termination shock" if deployment stops

--



.content-box-yellow[
**SRM is not a substitute for mitigation** — but may be needed as emergency measure.
]

---

# Given uncertainties, we need adaptation

&lt;br&gt;

Climate engineering has potential but also significant risks and unknowns.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**We will need to rely on adaptation** regardless of mitigation and engineering outcomes.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**What forms can adaptation take?**
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Climate Change Adaptation

---

# Forms of adaptation

&lt;br&gt;

**Large-scale infrastructure:**

- Sea walls for coastal protection
- Improved drainage systems
- Climate-resilient buildings

--

**Systems and services:**

- Early warning systems for disasters
- Heat action plans
- Climate-smart agriculture

--

**Behavioral changes:**

- Farmers plant different crops
- Households conserve water
- Migration to less vulnerable areas

---

# Example: Sea walls in Indonesia

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/indo_seawall.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Question:** What climate change adaptation strategies have been adopted in your country?

---

# Constraints to private adaptation

&lt;br&gt;

**Will private agents adapt on their own?**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Barriers to private adaptation:**

| Barrier | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Property rights** | Renters don't invest in flood-proofing |
| **Information gaps** | People don't know their climate risks |
| **Affordability** | Poor households can't afford adaptation investments |
| **Credit constraints** | Can't borrow for upfront adaptation costs |
| **Public infrastructure** | Private adaptation depends on public roads, grids |

---

# Role for government


**1. Correct market failures:**

- Address distorted incentives that lead to under-adaptation

--

**2. Provide information:**

- Climate risk data is a public good

--

**3. Financial support:**

- Help populations facing affordability constraints

--

**4. Public infrastructure:**

- Develop adaptation plans for transportation, water systems, etc.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Let's look at evidence on specific adaptation strategies.**

# Case Study 1: Indexed Disaster Funds in Mexico

del Valle (2024)

---

# The disaster aid problem

&lt;br&gt;

**In the last century:**

- 10,514 recorded storms, floods, and water-related disasters
- 8.3 million deaths directly attributed to disasters

--

**Deaths are skewed toward developing countries:**

- Not because disasters occur more there
- But because of **bottlenecks in disaster aid delivery**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Bottlenecks:**

- Reliance on post-disaster financing (slow)
- Lack of rules and administrative capacity
- Delays in restoring critical services

---

# Mexico's FONDEN: An indexed disaster fund

&lt;br&gt;

**What is FONDEN?**

- Insures public infrastructure and low-income housing against disasters
- Overcomes bottlenecks through structured response

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Key features:**

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Pre-disaster funding** | Protected budget, reinsurance, catastrophe bonds |
| **Rules-based disbursement** | Automatic triggers (e.g., rainfall threshold) |
| **Structured process** | Verify disaster → assess damage → pay → audit |

---

# FONDEN: Eligibility threshold

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/mexico1.png" style="width: 65%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Likelihood of receiving FONDEN increases from **0.65 just below** threshold to **0.87 just above**.

---

# FONDEN reduces disaster mortality

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/mexico2.png" style="width: 65%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

FONDEN decreases **0.82 excess deaths per 1,000 person-years** relative to ineligible municipalities.

---

# FONDEN: Key takeaways

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Pre-arranged disaster financing saves lives**

- Speed matters in disaster response
- Rules-based systems reduce delays

--

**2. Index-based triggers work**

- Automatic disbursement based on measurable thresholds
- Reduces political discretion and corruption

--

&lt;br&gt;

# Case Study 2: Public Health and Heat Mortality

Cohen (2022)

---

# Temperature and mortality in Mexico

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/mexico3.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Temperature kills — even at moderate levels

&lt;br&gt;

**Cohen (2022) findings:**

- Temperature variation causes ~**26,000 deaths/year** in Mexico
- This is **3.8% of annual deaths**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Surprising finding:**

| Temperature | Deaths/year |
|-------------|-------------|
| Extremely hot (&gt;32°C) | ~500 |
| Unusually cold (&lt;12°C) | ~5,700 |
| Mildly cold (12-20°C) | **~18,500** (71%) |

--

**Most weather-related deaths come from mildly cold days** — not extreme events.

---

# Income protects against temperature

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/mexico4.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Low-income groups are most vulnerable** to cold weather mortality.

---

# Can public policy reduce vulnerability?

&lt;br&gt;

**The Seguro Popular program:**

- Launched 2004 to increase universal healthcare
- Targeted people without employment-based insurance
- Focused on low-income, informal sector workers

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Context:**

- Before 2004: ~60% of population had no health insurance
- Major providers (IMSS, ISSSTE) linked to formal employment

---

# Seguro Popular reduces cold weather mortality

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="figures/mexico5.png" style="width: 55%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Estimated that Seguro Popular saves at least **1,600 lives per year** since 2004.

---

# Public health as adaptation: Key takeaways

&lt;br&gt;

**1. Climate vulnerability is shaped by institutions**

- Health insurance reduces mortality from temperature exposure
- Poor health systems amplify climate damages

--

**2. Adaptation doesn't always mean climate-specific policies**

- General improvements in health, income, infrastructure help
- "Development as adaptation"

--

&lt;br&gt;

# The problem with AC as adaptation

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
**Energy use explodes!**
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

**AC creates a feedback loop:**

1. Climate gets hotter
2. More AC adoption
3. More electricity demand
4. More emissions (if grid is fossil-fuel based)
5. Climate gets hotter...

# Group Activity: Adaptation Policy Design

**Instructions:** Form groups of 3-4. You are advisors to a developing country government.

&lt;br&gt;

**Your country:**

- Tropical climate, increasing heat waves
- Large informal sector, limited health insurance coverage
- Growing cities with inadequate infrastructure
- Limited government budget

---

# Group Activity: Adaptation Policy Design

**Task (15 minutes):** Design an adaptation strategy package.

&lt;br&gt;

**Consider:**

1. What are the main climate risks your country faces?

2. What mix of public and private adaptation measures would you recommend?

3. How would you address affordability constraints for low-income households?

4. How can you design policies that support both adaptation AND mitigation?

5. What are the political economy challenges? How would you address them?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Be prepared to present your top 3 recommendations** (3 min per group).

---

# Summary: What have we learned?

--

**1. Adaptation and mitigation are both necessary**

- Complements in optimal policy
- Neither alone is sufficient

--

**2. Climate engineering has potential but significant risks**

- CDR addresses root cause but is expensive and uncertain
- SRM treats symptoms with major governance challenges

--

**3. Effective adaptation takes many forms**

- Indexed disaster funds save lives (Mexico FONDEN)
- Health systems reduce climate vulnerability (Seguro Popular)
- Private adaptation (AC) works but has energy tradeoffs

--

**4. Best solutions combine adaptation and mitigation**

- LED lighting example: Less heat AND less energy

---

# Conclusion: The road ahead

&lt;br&gt;

**Climate change is a pressing challenge with unequal impacts.**

--

**Adaptation will be costly:**

- Monetarily expensive
- Potentially environmentally costly (e.g., AC → energy use)

--

**There is still limited evidence** on climate impacts and adaptation in LMICs.

--

&lt;br&gt;
