### Before we begin...

Think of a **development challenge** from your home country.

Take 2 minutes to write down:

1. What is the challenge?

2. Who is most affected?

3. What has been tried to address it?

&lt;br&gt;

As you listen to your classmates, think about:

- What **policy** was tried to address it?

--

- Did it **work**? How do we know?

  What is development?
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Development is a multidimensional concept

What does it mean by development?

--
*Rapid economic growth*? 

--
*Low inequality*? 

--
*Securing access to basic needs for all*?

--

In most cases, there are **trade-offs**, implying the need to establish social priorities.

--

It is important to be clear about what we mean, when making judgement about development.

--

A good starting point is the Millennium Development Goals.

---

# Millenium Development Goals (MDG) 

The 8 goals were set in 2000, to be achieved in 2015.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/mdg.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

SDGs build on MDGs that ended in 2015 with 17 goals and 169 targets.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/sdg.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Based on MDGs, we can agree on seven dimensions of development, i.e., seven horsemen of underdevelopment.


---

# Seven horsemen of underdevelopment
  
First, low levels of income and insufficient income growth to allow income convergence.

---

# Seven horsemen of underdevelopment
  
Second, extensive material poverty accompanied by food insecurity and hunger.

&lt;/div&gt;

---

Fifth, lack of satisfaction of basic needs in human development, e.g., health and education.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/school.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" /&gt;

---

  &lt;img src="figures/waste.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

Here are key takeaways about development:

--

- It is more than just economic growth (increases in income); it includes social progress like health, education, political participation, and environmental sustainability.

--

- Development means creating and utilizing economic, human, social, and financial assets to improve broadly shared well-being.

--

- Sustainable development focuses on meeting present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet theirs, balancing economic, social, and environmental factors.

--

How do we measure development to assess progress and design effective interventions? 

---

class: inverse

While development includes many qualitative dimensions, **having standardized, quantifiable indicators** is essential for comparison across countries and over time. 

--

Two of the most widely used aggregate economic measures that provide insight into a country's overall economic performance and capacity to improve well-being are:

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and 

- Gross National Income (GNI).



---

# Measuring development

--

**GDP** (Gross Domestic Product): economic output generated by resident producers, regardless of ownership, within a country.

--

**GNI** (Gross National Income): total amount of factor incomes earned by the residents of a country.

--

`$$\text{GNI} = \text{GDP} + \text{Income Earned By Residents from Abroad} - \text{Income Earned By Non-Residents Domestically}$$`

--

These measures are expressed in monetary terms (commonly USD using **conversion factors**) for international comparability.

  - World Bank Atlas method and purchasing power parity (PPP) rates are two common factors.
  
  - These measures have their limitations, and do not capture the social/environmental dimensions.
  
---

# Purchasing power parity (PPP)

PPP allows us to compare the relative value of currencies by measuring the purchasing power of different countries’ currencies to buy the same **basket of goods and services.**

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/basket.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

--

What are some problems with PPP? 

--
- Different baskets of goods: people consume different goods and services, so there is no truly comparable basket.

- Prices of non-tradable goods are services (e.g., housing) vary widely and are not internationally linked.

- Quality and measurement differences: differences in product quality, availability, and statistical methods can distort PPP estimates, etc.

---

# The World Bank Income Classifications

The World Bank classifies countries into income groups to better analyze development progress and target assistance.

--

Income groups are based on GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, which smooths exchange rate fluctuations and inflation.

--

There are four groups:
  
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/inc.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The World Bank Income Classifications

Look at the following graphics, what patterns do you notice on development progress?

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups?time=2024&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;



---

# The World Bank Income Classifications

Significant Shift in Income Groups Over Time:

  - Since 1987, there has been a notable decrease in the share of low-income countries.
  
--

Regional Variations in Development Progress:

  - South Asia has dramatically reduced its low-income country share
  
  - Middle East and North Africa have seen some increase in low-income countries 
  
  - Latin America and the Caribbean have expanded their share of high-income countries significantly
  
--

Annual Reclassification Reflects Economic Growth and Recent Events:

  - For 2024-2025, West Bank and Gaza moved downward due to economic contractions caused by conflict.


---

class: inverse 

Why do we care so much about these economic growth and income measures?

--

Because, as we will see now, they are closely linked to people’s well-being.

--

Understanding this relationship helps us grasp why income classifications matter beyond just dollars and cents.

# These income differences matter for infant mortality

Generally, higher income is associated with lower infant mortality.

  &lt;img src="figures/income_infantm.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;

  What causes underdevelopment? &lt;br&gt;
  
  Or put it differently, what induces development?
  
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# What causes underdevelopment?

Different scholars, different answers:

--

**Jeffrey Sachs**: Big push — massive aid and subsidies can shift countries to a better equilibrium

--

**William Easterly**: Small experiments — skeptical of grand plans, favors NGO-led trial and error

--

**Dani Rodrik**: Context matters — each country has unique binding constraints, no one-size-fits-all

--

**Banerjee &amp; Duflo**: Evidence first — use rigorous evaluation (RCTs) to find what actually works

---

# Let's hear from one of them

.center[
### Esther Duflo: Social experiments to fight poverty

&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/esther_duflo_social_experiments_to_fight_poverty"&gt;ted.com/talks/esther_duflo_social_experiments_to_fight_poverty&lt;/a&gt;
] 

&lt;br&gt;

**As you watch, think about:**

1. Why does she say we need experiments?

2. What's wrong with just asking "Did poverty go down after the program?"


---

# Where does this course fit?

We follow the **Banerjee &amp; Duflo** approach:

- Focus on specific policies and programs

- Ask: **Does this work? For whom? Why?**

- Use data and rigorous methods to find out

You have seen that development is a multifaceted process, with income playing a major role in shaping many development outcomes.

--

Given the vast scope of development, we cannot cover every aspect comprehensively.

--

Instead, we will focus on selected key themes and policy challenges, using rigorous impact evaluation methods to gain deep insights into core areas of development policy.
