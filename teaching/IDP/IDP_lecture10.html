# Opening question

A farmer in rural India has rice straw left after harvest. She has two options:

--

.pull-left[
**Option A: Burn the straw**
- Free and fast
- Clears field for next planting
- But smoke travels to Delhi...
]

.pull-right[
**Option B: Use machines**
- Costs money and time
- Better for air quality
- But she can't afford it
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;

Every year, crop burning causes severe air pollution in Delhi, contributing to thousands of deaths.

# Session 1

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Understanding Environmental Problems
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# What is sustainable development?

Sustainable development means balancing three interconnected areas:

--

**The three pillars:**

1. **Environment:** Protecting nature and natural resources

2. **Social:** Ensuring fairness, health, and well-being for everyone

3. **Economy:** Supporting jobs, income, and prosperity

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Key insight:** These three areas are deeply connected — we need to think about all of them together.
]

---

# Why do environmental problems occur?

To understand environmental problems, we need to understand how markets work — and when they fail.

--

**When markets work well:**
- Buyers and sellers interact freely
- Prices reflect true costs and benefits
- Resources are allocated efficiently

--

**When markets fail:**
- Prices don't reflect true costs (pollution is "free")
- Some goods have no market at all (clean air)
- Individual decisions harm others

--

&lt;br&gt;

Let's build up this understanding step by step.

---

# How markets work: A coffee example

Consider the market for coffee — a simple private good.

--

**Demand:** How much coffee buyers want at different prices
- Higher price → people buy less coffee
- Lower price → people buy more coffee

--

**Supply:** How much coffee sellers offer at different prices
- Higher price → sellers want to sell more
- Lower price → sellers want to sell less

---

# Coffee demand

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand_supply2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Reading this graph:** At $2 per cup, buyers want to purchase 800 cups per day.

The demand curve shows **marginal benefit** — what buyers are willing to pay for one more cup.

---

# Coffee supply

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand_supply3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Reading this graph:** At $2 per cup, sellers want to sell 1,867 cups per day.

The supply curve shows **marginal cost** — what it costs to produce one more cup.

---

# Market equilibrium

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand_supply1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Equilibrium:** The price where demand equals supply. At this price:
- All buyers find sellers
- All sellers find buyers
- The market "clears"

---

# When markets work well

For coffee, this market works well because:

--

- **All costs are paid by the seller** (coffee beans, labor, rent)
- **All benefits go to the buyer** (enjoying the coffee)
- **No one else is affected**

--

&lt;br&gt;

The price reflects the true cost of production, and the quantity produced is efficient.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**But what if producing something affects people who aren't buying or selling?**
]

---

# Externalities

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
When markets fail
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# What is an externality?

&gt; An **externality** occurs when one person's actions have a **direct**, **unintentional**, and **uncompensated** effect on others.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Key elements:**
- **Direct:** The effect doesn't go through the market
- **Unintentional:** Not the main purpose of the action
- **Uncompensated:** No payment for the harm (or benefit) caused

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Examples:**
- A factory pollutes a river → fishermen downstream lose income
- You get vaccinated → others are less likely to get sick
- Your neighbor plays loud music → you can't sleep

---

# Types of externalities

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Negative production** | Firm's production harms others | Factory pollution |
| **Positive production** | Firm's production benefits others | R&amp;D innovations |
| **Negative consumption** | Your consumption harms others | Traffic congestion |
| **Positive consumption** | Your consumption benefits others | Vaccination |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Environmental problems are typically negative externalities** — someone's actions harm others who aren't compensated.
]

---

# Example: Steel production and pollution

Steel furnaces burn coal, which emits pollution that harms people's health.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/steel.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Let's see how this creates a market failure.

---

# Steel market without considering pollution

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality4.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**What the firm sees:**
- **Private marginal cost:** Raw materials, labor, energy
- The firm produces where its private cost equals the market price
- Result: Quantity `\(Q_M\)` is produced

---

# But pollution creates additional costs!

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Marginal damage (MD):** The harm caused by pollution for each additional ton of steel
- Health costs (hospital visits, lost work days)
- Environmental damage (acid rain, crop losses)
- These costs are real — but the firm doesn't pay them!

---

# The true social cost

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Social marginal cost = Private cost + Damage from pollution**

The efficient quantity is `\(Q^*\)`, but the market produces `\(Q_M\)`.

---

# The market failure: A numerical example

Suppose producing 1 ton of steel:

| Cost type | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Private cost (materials, labor) | $500 |
| Pollution damage (health, environment) | $100 |
| **True social cost** | **$600** |

--

**The problem:**
- Market price: $550 per ton
- Firm sees: $500 cost &lt; $550 price → Produce!
- Society sees: $600 cost &gt; $550 benefit → Don't produce!

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Result:** Too much steel is produced (and too much pollution) because the firm doesn't pay for the damage it causes.
]

---

# Why do externalities arise?

**1. Poorly defined property rights**

--

- Who owns the right to clean air?
- Who owns the right to clean water?
- If no one "owns" these resources, no one can charge for using them

--

**2. High transaction costs**

--

- Even if rights were clear, bargaining is hard
- Millions of people affected by pollution
- Can't negotiate with each person individually

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Public Goods

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Another type of market failure
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# What are public goods?

Public goods have two special characteristics:

--

**1. Non-rival:** One person's use doesn't reduce availability for others
- Example: A lighthouse — one ship using it doesn't prevent others from using it

--

**2. Non-excludable:** You can't prevent people from using it
- Example: National defense — protects everyone, whether they pay taxes or not

---

# Classifying goods

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/publicgoods.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Environmental examples:** Clean air (public good), fish in the ocean (common resource)
- national parks (can be made excludable with entry fees)

---

# Why are public goods under-provided?

**The free-rider problem:**

--

- If you can benefit without paying, why pay?
- Everyone waits for others to pay
- Result: No one pays, good isn't provided

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example: Village flood protection**
- Building a wall protects everyone in the village
- But each person thinks: "Let my neighbor pay for it"
- Result: Wall never gets built

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**This is why governments often provide public goods** — markets alone won't supply enough.
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Policy Solutions

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
How can we fix market failures?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Two approaches to fixing market failures

**1. Private solutions (Coase Theorem)**

--

- If property rights are clear and bargaining is easy, people can negotiate
- Example: Factory and fishermen negotiate compensation
- **Problem:** Often impractical with many people affected

--

**2. Government policy instruments**

--

- When private bargaining fails, government intervenes
- Multiple tools available:
  - Command-and-control regulations
  - Emission taxes
  - Cap-and-trade systems
  - Information-based approaches

---

# Command-and-control regulations

The government directly regulates behavior by setting rules and standards.

--

**Example: Brazil's Forest Code**
- Landowners in the Amazon must maintain 80% native forest
- Clear rules, direct enforcement

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/amazon.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Command-and-control regulations

The government directly regulates behavior by setting rules and standards.

**Example: Indonesia's Timber Legality Verification (SVLK)**
- Timber companies must prove wood is legally sourced
- Certification required for export

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/indo.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Pros:** Clear rules, easy to understand
**Cons:** Inflexible, may not be cost-effective

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Emission Taxes

---

# How emission taxes work

When a polluter faces an emission tax, it must **pay a fee for each unit of pollution**.

--

**The logic:**
- Government claims property rights to clean air on behalf of citizens
- Sells the "right to pollute" back to firms at a price (the tax)

--

**This solves both problems:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Poorly defined property rights | Assigned to government |
| High transaction costs | Simple flat fee per unit |

---

# Emission tax: A numerical example

Suppose the pollution damage is $100 per ton of steel.

--

**Before tax:**
- Firm's cost: $500/ton
- Price: $550/ton
- Firm produces (profit = $50/ton)

--

**After $100 tax:**
- Firm's cost: $500 + $100 = $600/ton
- Price: $550/ton
- Firm stops producing (would lose $50/ton)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**The tax makes the firm "internalize" the externality** — it now pays the true social cost.
]

---

# Example: Sweden's carbon tax

Sweden introduced a carbon tax in 1991, increasing gradually over time.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/sweden_carbontax.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key feature:** Gradual increases allow households and businesses to adapt, improving political feasibility.

---

# Cap-and-Trade

---

# Cap-and-trade: The concept

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfNgsKrPKsg?si=6T2tUmpx1jdG7OwS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# How cap-and-trade works

**Step 1: Set the cap**
- Government decides total allowable pollution
- Example: 1 million tons of CO₂ per year

--

**Step 2: Distribute permits**
- Each permit allows 1 ton of pollution
- Permits given to firms (free or auctioned)

--

**Step 3: Allow trading**
- Firms can buy/sell permits
- At year end, must have permits for all emissions

---

# Why trading makes it efficient

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/cap1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Firm A:** Can reduce emissions cheaply → Reduces more, sells extra permits

**Firm B:** Expensive to reduce emissions → Buys permits instead

**Result:** Same total reduction, but at lowest total cost!

---

# Cap-and-trade around the world

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Comparing policy instruments

| Instrument | How it works | Pros | Cons |
|------------|--------------|------|------|
| **Command-and-control** | Direct rules | Clear, enforceable | Inflexible |
| **Emission tax** | Price on pollution | Simple, revenue | Hard to set right price |
| **Cap-and-trade** | Limit + trading | Certain quantity | Complex to administer |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**No single best approach** — the right tool depends on context, capacity, and goals.
]

---

# Session 1 summary

--

**Sustainable development** balances environment, economy, and society.

--

**Markets fail** when prices don't reflect true costs — this happens with externalities and public goods.

--

**Externalities** occur when one person's actions harm (or help) others without compensation.

--

**Public goods** are under-provided because of the free-rider problem.

--

**Policy instruments** include command-and-control, emission taxes, and cap-and-trade — each with trade-offs.

# Session 2

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Environment and Development
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The developing country challenge

In many developing countries:

--

- Large portions of the population **depend on natural resources for survival**

--

- People may engage in **environmentally harmful activities** out of necessity:
  - Clearing forests for farming
  - Burning crop residue
  - Overfishing

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**The dilemma:** How do we protect the environment without further impoverishing the poor?
]

---

# Example: Deforestation in Uganda

Main drivers of deforestation:
- Subsistence agriculture
- Demand for timber and charcoal

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/uganda1.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For poor farmers, clearing forest may be their only option for survival.

---

# Example: Crop burning in India

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/burn.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Farmers burn rice straw because: it's free and fast, machines are expensive
- They need to plant the next crop quickly

---

# Why traditional policies often fail

The Indian government has tried many policies:

--

**Since 2015:**
- Burning is banned and punishable by fines
- Subsidies for equipment that removes residue

--

**But there's a gap between rules and reality:**

--

- Powerful farmer lobby undermines enforcement
- Subsidies don't cover full equipment costs
- Pollution crosses state borders (no single state wants to enforce)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Banning or punishing may also be undesirable** — it could further impoverish already poor farmers.
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES)

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
A different approach
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The PES concept

**Instead of punishing harmful behavior, reward good behavior.**

--

Financial rewards are provided to individuals or communities in exchange for environmentally beneficial actions.

--

&lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="750" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzNWnREZ2xI?si=wdmKelbk9KgzfS6p&amp;amp;start=8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Evidence: PES reduces deforestation in Uganda

**Study:** [Jayachandran et al. (2017)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan0568) — Randomized Controlled Trial

--

**Design:**
- 60 villages: Households offered payments to keep their forest intact
- 60 villages: No intervention (control)

--

**The offer:** Cash payments if satellite images confirm forest is preserved

--

&lt;br&gt;

**What would you expect to happen?**

---

# Uganda PES: Results

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/jaya3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://poverty-action.org/testing-effectiveness-payments-ecosystem-services-enhance-conservation-uganda"&gt;Innovations for Poverty Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Finding:** PES significantly reduced deforestation in treatment villages.

---

# When does PES work?

PES can be effective, but it's not a universal solution.

--

**Conditions for success:**

| Factor | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Clear property rights | Need to know who should receive payments |
| Ability to monitor | Must verify that conservation actually happens |
| Payments &gt; opportunity costs | Must be worth more than alternative uses |
| Low transaction costs | Administering payments must be feasible |

---

# When PES may fail

--

**Institutional weaknesses:**
- Unclear land tenure — who should receive payment?
- Weak monitoring — how to verify compliance?

--

**High transaction costs:**
- Identifying participants
- Negotiating contracts
- Enforcing agreements

--

**Motivation crowding:**
- Paying people may undermine intrinsic motivation to conserve
- "I was protecting the forest because it's right; now I only do it for money"

--

**Context matters:**
- Social, cultural, economic factors influence success
- What works in Uganda may not work elsewhere

# Climate Change

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
A global challenge
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Climate change: Unequal contributions

Most developing countries contribute very little to global greenhouse gas emissions.

&lt;/div&gt;



---

# Climate mitigation vs. adaptation

**Mitigation:** Reduce the cause of climate change

--

- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- Increase carbon absorption (forests, technology)
- Requires global cooperation

--

**Adaptation:** Reduce the harm from climate change

--

- Build sea walls for rising sea levels
- Develop drought-resistant crops
- Improve early warning systems
- Relocate vulnerable communities

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Both are needed** — mitigation to limit future warming, adaptation to cope with changes already happening.
]

---

# International cooperation: Where are we?

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B11kASPfYxY?si=gFVmhNEfe6V6tWoB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why is international cooperation so hard?

--

**Free-rider problem:**
- Countries benefit from others' emission cuts without cutting their own
- Each country waits for others to act first

--

**Short-term costs vs. long-term benefits:**
- Cutting emissions requires expensive investments now
- Benefits accrue far in the future
- Politicians focus on short-term gains

--

**Weak enforcement:**
- Paris Agreement relies on voluntary commitments
- No penalties for non-compliance
- Countries can withdraw (as the US did in 2017)

---

# The fundamental challenge

Climate change is the ultimate **global public good problem**:

--

- Benefits of action are shared globally
- Costs are borne locally
- No global government to enforce cooperation

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This is why climate negotiations are so difficult** — but also why they're so important.

---

# Main takeaways

**Sustainable development** requires balancing environment, economy, and society.

--

**Market failures** (externalities, public goods) explain why environmental degradation occurs.

--

**Policy instruments** include regulations, taxes, and cap-and-trade — each with trade-offs.

--

**In developing countries,** traditional policies often fail due to weak institutions, high transaction costs, and poverty.

--

**Payment for Ecosystem Services** offers an alternative by rewarding good behavior — but success depends on context.

--

**Climate change** is a global challenge with unequal contributions and impacts 

- developing countries bear disproportionate risks.

--

**International cooperation** is essential but difficult due to free-riding, short-term thinking, and weak enforcement.
