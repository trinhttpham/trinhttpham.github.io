  What is sustainable development?
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

class: inverse 

**Sustainable development means balancing three key areas**:

--

- **Environment**: Protecting nature and natural resources.

--

- **Social**: Ensuring fairness, health, and well-being for everyone.

--

- **Economy**: Supporting jobs, income, and prosperity.

--

To be truly sustainable, we need to think about all three at the same timeâ€”they are deeply connected.


---

class: inverse 

This week, we analyze the origins of environmental problems 

- and their impact on development through fundamental economic concepts.

--

We will then introduce several policy instruments to address these challenges.

--

For those interested in a deeper exploration of these development-environmental topics, 

- the course **Environmental Economics in Developing Countries** (Spring 2026) offers more insights.

&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Market failures due to externalities
&lt;/div&gt; 



---

# Market failures

Consider the market of a private good (coffee).

- we have a **decentralized** collection of buyers and sellers whose interactions determine the allocation of a good or set of goods through **exchange**

--

We can use two curves to demonstrate the supply and the demand for coffee:

--

- **Demand curve**: a graph showing the quantity of a good that buyers in the aggregate are willing to buy at a given market price, with all other factors (such as the prices of other goods) held constant. 

--

  - It gives the marginal willingness to pay or the **marginal benefit**.

--

- **Supply curve**: a graph showing the quantity of a good that sellers are willing to sell or produce at a given price. 

--

  - It gives the marginal willingness to accept or the **marginal cost**.


---

# Coffee demand

Market demand is aggregated from all individual demand curves.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand_supply2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  - if buyers face a price of $2/cup of coffee they are willing to buy 800 cups/day.

---

# Coffee supply

Market supply is aggregated from all individual supply curves.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand_supply3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  - if sellers face a price of $2/cup of coffee they are willing to sell 1867 cups/day.


---

# Market equilibrium

Market equilibrium is the combination of quantity and price for which demand equals supply.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand_supply1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

At equilibrium price, the market clears: 

- all buyers are able to find sellers, and all sellers are able to find buyers.


---

# Market failures

For coffee, the private costs and benefits are likely the social costs and benefits.

--

- However, **most environmental goods have no market or price**.

--

- There is no price for air pollution, water pollution, or biodiversity.

--

We have **externalities**.

--

&gt; An externality results when the actions of one individual (or firm) have a **direct**, **unintentional**, and **uncompensated** effect on the well-being of other individuals or the profits of other firms.
&gt;



---

# Externalities: several classifications

**Production externalities**: generated by a firm in the process of producing some output 
  
  - (e.g., pollution, innovation)

--

**Consumption externalities**: generated by an individual in the process of consuming an output 

  - (e.g., congestion, vaccination)

--

**Negative externalities**: imposes external costs (e.g., pollution)

--

**Positive externalities**: imposes external benefits (e.g., vaccination)


---

# Negative externalities

Steel furnaces typically burn coal, emitting pollution. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/steel.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# Negative externalities

Steel furnaces typically burn coal, emitting pollution. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- Assume the marginal damage (MD) caused by pollution is a function of amount of steel produced.

---

# Negative externalities

Steel furnaces typically burn coal, emitting pollution. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality4.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- Absent regulation, each producer ignores the damages and the supply curve only corresponds to the private MC.


---

# Negative externalities

But there is another cost of production that the producers do not pay! The damages from pollution.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Adding the private MC and the MD together gives us the social MC---thing we care about from the regulator's perspective.
  
---

# Negative externalities

But there is another cost of production that the producers do not pay! The damages from pollution.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/externality3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The unregulated market results in too much output `\(Q_M&gt;Q*\)` (and thus too much pollution)!
  
---

# Why do externalities arise?

There are typically two main reasons:

--

- Poorly defined property rights:

--

  - Who owns the right to the air? 

--

  - Who owns the right to the water? 

--

  - Who owns the right to the biodiversity? 

--

- High transaction costs:

  - It is hard to bargain over desired air/water quality with millions of people.
  
  
---

class: inverse, middle, center

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  A related concept is Public Goods.
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Public goods

Public goods have two fundamental characteristics:

--

- **Nonrival**: the amount of any individual's consumption does not diminish the amount available for others.

--

- **Non-excludable**: individuals cannot be prevented from enjoying a public good.

---

# Public goods 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/publicgoods.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Public goods are underprovided because individuals often do not value them sufficiently to pay for them, especially since they cannot be excluded from benefiting regardless of contribution.

&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  What could be solutions to these market failures?
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

class: inverse

Solutions to market failures can be broadly categorized into two types:

--

- Private-sector solutions (**Coase Theorem**):

--

  - When there are **well-defined property rights** and **costless bargaining**, then negotiations between the party creating the externality and the party affected by the externality can bring about the socially optimal market quantity.
  
--

  - The efficient solution to an externality does not depend on which party is assigned the property rights, as long as someone is assigned those rights.
  
--

- Policy instruments:

--

  - In cases where private bargaining is impractical or insufficient, government intervention through policy tools becomes necessary.
  
  - These tools include regulations, taxes, subsidies, tradable permits (cap-and-trade), and others that aim to correct market failures and promote sustainability.

--

We will briefly discuss several policy instruments used to address environmental externalities and other market failures.

---

# The arrays of policy instruments

**Command-and-control**, focuses on regulating the behavior or performance of *individuals, factories, and plants* 

--

- Brazil's Forest Code sets legal requirements for landowners in the Amazon to maintain a certain percentage of native forest on their property (e.g., 80%).
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/amazon.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# The arrays of policy instruments

**Command-and-control**, focuses on regulating the behavior or performance of *individuals, factories, and plants* 

- Indonesia requires timber companies to follow the SVLK certification (a timber legality verification system) to ensure harvested wood is legally sourced.
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/indo.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# The arrays of policy instruments

**Market-based policies**: rather than individual technology or performance, market-based policies are *more decentralized, focusing on aggregate or market-level outcomes* 

  - *Emission taxes* or *abatement subsidies* focus on influencing prices of emissions

  - *Cap-and-trade* focus on limiting quantities of emissions

--

**Information-based approaches**: address market failure from *asymmetric information*, but do not address problems of externalities and public goods provision

  - *Right-to-know laws* require information provision by private firms

  - *Ecolabeling* and *certification* programs provide consumers with information about how a product was manufactured


---

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Emission taxes
&lt;/div&gt; 



---

# Emission taxes

When a polluter faces an emission tax, it must **pay a fee to the regulator for each unit of emissions**.

--

- It is **as if the government claimed the property rights** to the air on behalf of the citizens, and then **sold the rights to pollute back to the firm at the price** "tax".

--

It solves the two big problems with externalities

  1. Poorly defined property rights (assigned to the regulator)
  
  2. High transaction costs (pay a flat fee)
  

---

# Emission taxes: Sweden carbon tax

The carbon tax was introduced in 1991, with tax rate increasing gradually and in a stepwise manner.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/sweden_carbontax.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

This allows households and businesses to adapt over time, which has improved the political feasibility of tax increases. 


---

class: inverse

Weâ€™ve seen how **emission taxes put a direct price** on pollution.

--

Next, we explore **cap-and-trade, which limits the total pollution allowed** 

  - and lets the market find the price.

--

Both aim to reduce emissions but use different approaches.

--

Understanding cap-and-trade adds another tool to the policy toolkit for sustainable development.


---

# Cap and trade 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="900" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfNgsKrPKsg?si=6T2tUmpx1jdG7OwS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Cap and trade

This is also known as allowance trading.

--

- The government first **establishes a total allowable quantity of pollution ("the cap") for a group of emitters** (e.g., industrial sources of pollution)

--

- The government then **allocates allowances ("tradable permits") to the regulated entities**, with each allowance corresponding to one unit of pollution.

--

- At the end of each compliance period (usually a year), **emitters must submit one allowance for each unit of pollution** they have emitted. 


---

# Cap and trade

The total amount of pollution is fixed by regulation, but the **allocation** of that pollution among firms is left up to the market.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/cap1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- Firms with a greater potential for reducing GHG emissions (lower marginal reduction cost) can reduce emissions more than they are required and sell the surplus in the market.

--

- Whereas firms with a lower reduction potential (higher marginal emission reduction cost) can purchase extra permits instead of reducing emissions directly.

&lt;/div&gt;

class: inverse

In many developing countries, **large portions of the population depend on natural resources for subsistence**, 

- and **they may engage in activities harmful to the environment**, such as:

  - forest clearing for timber production 

  - burning rice straw residue after harvest.

--

This creates a complex dynamic between environmental protection and economic development.

--

Our goal is to **protect the environment without further impoverishing the poor**.


---

# Deforestation in Uganda 

As in much of Africa, the main drivers of deforestation in the study region are subsistence agriculture and domestic demand for timber and charcoal.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/uganda1.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Burning rice straw in India

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/burn.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

class: inverse

Why can't we just implement some policy instruments above?

--

In fact, the Indian government has implemented many policies:

  - Since 2015, burning residue has been banned and punishable by fines. 
  
  - The government also introduced subsidies for farm equipment that removes residue without burning.
  
--

However, there is (always) a gap between **de jure** rules and **de facto** action:

--

- The externalityâ€™s interjurisdictional nature and a powerful farmer lobby have undermined political incentives to
 enforce the ban.

--

- Subsidy levels are insufficient to cover the full cost of equipment use, and are restricted to certain equipment. 
  
--

With the existing policy mix, crop residue burning remains widespread.

--

**Banning/punishing environmental harm might also be undesirable if it further impoverishes the poor**.

---

&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Then what could we do?
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

class: inverse, middle, center


&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  A different approach is to **reward people for pro-environmental actions**. 
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Payment for ecosystems (PES)

Financial rewards are provided to individuals or communities in exchange for engaging in environmentally beneficial actions. 

&lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzNWnREZ2xI?si=wdmKelbk9KgzfS6p&amp;amp;start=8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# PES reduces deforestation in Uganda

Randomized Controlled Trial:

- Households that owned primary forest in 60 treatment villages were offered money if they left their forest intact.

--

What is your expectation regarding the deforestation rates in control and treatment villages?

&lt;/div&gt;


---

class: inverse, center, middle

&lt;div style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Does PES always work?
&lt;/div&gt; 



---

# PES does not always work

- Institutional and political weaknesses can hinder implementation. 

  - Lack of clear property or land tenure rights prevents establishing who should receive payments and who should comply.

--

- High transaction costsâ€”such as identifying participants, negotiating contracts, monitoring compliance, and enforcing agreementsâ€”can limit effectiveness and scalability.

--

- PES may shift responsibility for conservation from service providers to payers, which can undermine intrinsic motivations or existing informal conservation efforts.

--

- The expected environmental and social benefits sometimes do not materialize if monitoring and evaluation are inadequate, or if payments are insufficient compared to opportunity costs of harmful activities.

--

- Context-specific social, cultural, economic, and political factors strongly influence success. 

--

Thus, PES should not be seen as a universal solution but one option that may work better in some settings than others.


---

class: inverse

So far, we have focused mainly on domestic market failures and policy tools like emission taxes and payment for ecosystem services.

--

However, there are **global challenges that transcends national borders**, requiring international cooperation to effectively address.

--

Many developing countries contribute very little to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet they face some of the most severe adverse impacts from climate change.

--

These countries often have limited capacity to **adapt or mitigate climate risks**, highlighting the importance of global mechanisms that support them.

We've mentioned that countries might have limited capacity to **adapt or mitigate climate risks.**

--

Are climate change mitigation and adaptation the same?

--

- **Mitigation** attempts to moderate the temperature rise by using strategies designed to **reduce emissions or to increase the planetâ€™s natural capacity to absorb greenhouse gases**.

  - cooperation and negotiations like Paris Agreement

--

- **Adaptation strategies** involve efforts to modify natural or human systems to **minimize harm from climate change impacts**.

  - building sea walls to protect against sea-level rise
  
  - improved early warning systems 

  - farmers plant different crops
  
  - households relocate their dwellings to higher land for flood protection

---

# Why negotiations might not work?

--

**Free rider problem**:

  - Countries benefit from global climate action without reducing their own emissions.

--

**Short-term costs vs. long-term benefits**:

  - Cutting emissions often requires high upfront investments in renewable energy and infrastructure.
  
  - Governments prioritize economic growth, jobs, and short-term political gains over long-term climate stability.

--

**Weak enforcement and accountability**:

  - Climate agreements like the Paris Agreement rely on voluntary commitments, with no penalties for non-compliance.

---

# Main Takeaways

- Sustainable development requires balancing environmental protection, economic growth, and social equity, recognizing their deep interconnections.

--

- Market failures such as externalities, public goods, and missing markets explain why environmental degradation occurs despite individual incentives.

--

- Addressing these market failures demands policy interventions.

--

- In many developing country settings, institutional and capacity challenges complicate enforcement of traditional policies and require tailored approaches.

--

- Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) represents an innovative tool that incentivizes conservation by directly rewarding pro-environmental actions, but it faces limitations related to rights, transactions, and context specificity.

--

- Climate change is a global challenge characterized by uneven contributions and impacts, with many developing countries bearing disproportionate risks while having limited emissions.

--

- Effective response to climate change requires international cooperation through agreements, finance, and technology transfer, complementing national mitigation and adaptation efforts.
