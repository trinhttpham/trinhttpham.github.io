# Opening question

Suppose a policymaker asks you: **How can we increase school attendance in our village?**

--

Which intervention would you recommend?

.pull-left[
- Hiring additional teachers
- Providing school meals
- Supplying school uniforms
- Offering student scholarships
]

.pull-right[
- Giving iron supplements
- Administering deworming pills
- Conditional cash transfers
- Information about returns to education
]

th, td { padding: 10px 15px; }
&lt;/style&gt;

# The surprising answer

&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Deworming** — one of the cheapest interventions — had among the largest impacts per dollar spent.

--

Without rigorous evidence, we might have chosen a more expensive, less effective option.

---

# What is evidence-based policy?

Evidence-based policy means making decisions based on **rigorous research**, not just intuition or anecdotes.

--

**Why does this matter?**

- Resources are limited — we need to know what works best
- Good intentions don't guarantee good outcomes
- Some programs that "sound good" don't actually work

--

**Key tools:**

- Household surveys and data collection
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Careful statistical analysis

--

&lt;br&gt;

Today's lecture focuses on a critical challenge: **How do we know if something actually works?**

# Correlation vs. Causation

---

# A motivating example

Suppose we want to know: **Does a mother's education improve her child's health?**

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/correlation.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;
  .small[Source: &lt;a href="https://www.gapminder.org"&gt;Gapminder&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;/div&gt;

--

We observe a **positive correlation**: countries where women have more education also have healthier children.

---

# Can we conclude causation?

**Does this mean we should invest in women's education to improve child health?**

--

Not so fast! Think about what else might be going on:

--

- Women with more education often come from **wealthier families**

--

- They may marry **more educated men**

--

- They likely live in areas with **better healthcare and sanitation**

--

&lt;br&gt;

These factors affect **both** mother's education **and** child health.

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Key term:** Variables that affect both the cause and the outcome are called **confounders** or **omitted variables**.
]

---

# The confounding problem

Think of it this way:

--

**Family wealth** influences:
- How much education the mother receives (wealthier families can afford more schooling)
- How healthy the child is (through better nutrition, healthcare, housing)

--

&lt;br&gt;

So when we see educated mothers with healthy children, we can't tell if it's because of:

- The education itself, **OR**
- The wealth that enabled both

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**This is the core problem:** We see a relationship, but we don't know what's actually causing what.

# Another example: Ice cream and drowning

  &lt;img src="./figures/icecream_drowning.svg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Group discussion (5 minutes)

Think of other examples where correlation might be mistaken for causation:

--

.pull-left[
**Some possibilities:**

- Farmers who use fertilizer have higher yields

- Households with microloans have higher incomes

- Children who attend school are healthier

]

.pull-right[
&lt;div style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4caf50;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;💡 Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the potential confounder that affects both variables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 60%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 35%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

# Introduction to Regression

---

# What is regression?

Regression is a statistical tool that helps us **examine relationships between variables**.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/OLS0.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Each dot represents one mother-child pair. Can we draw a line through these points?

---

# What is regression?

**Basic idea:** Find the line that best summarizes the relationship in the data.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/OLS0.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

But which line is "best"?

---

# Finding the best-fitting line

We could draw many different lines through the data...

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/OLS4.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# The regression approach

For any line, we can measure how far each point is from the line.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/OLS5.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Regression finds the line that minimizes these distances** (specifically, the sum of squared distances).

---

# The regression line

This method is called **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** — it gives us the "best-fitting" line.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/OLS1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

This line has an equation: **Child Health = 40.9 + 2.1 × Mother's Education**

---

# Interpreting the regression

**Child Health = 40.9 + 2.1 × Mother's Education**

--

What does this tell us?

--

- **40.9** is the starting point (predicted life expectancy when mother's education = 0)

--

- **2.1** is the **slope** — for each additional year of mother's education, child health is **associated with** a 2.1 unit increase

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Important language:** We say "associated with," not "causes." 

- **The regression shows us the relationship in the data, but doesn't prove causation.**
]

---

# The regression equation

Let's introduce some notation (don't worry — we'll keep it simple):

`$$\large Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

| Symbol | Meaning | In our example |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `\(Y_i\)` | Outcome for person `\(i\)` | Child health |
| `\(X_i\)` | Variable of interest for person `\(i\)` | Mother's education |
| `\(\beta_0\)` | Intercept (starting point) | 40.9 |
| `\(\beta_1\)` | Slope (relationship) | 2.1 |
| `\(\varepsilon_i\)` | Everything else affecting `\(Y\)` | Family wealth, genetics, etc. |

--

&lt;br&gt;

The subscript `\(i\)` just means "for each person in our data."

---

# The error term

Let's take a closer look:

`$$\large Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

The **error term** `\(\varepsilon_i\)` captures everything that affects child health **other than** mother's education:

--

- Family wealth
- Father's education
- Genetics
- Access to healthcare
- Neighborhood environment
- ... and many other factors

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** All those confounders we worried about? They're hiding in the error term.
]

---

# Why regression helps (a little)

One advantage of regression: we can **control for other factors**.

--

Instead of just:

`$$\text{Child Health}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Mother's Education}_i + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

We can add more variables:

`$$\text{Child Health}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Mother's Education}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{Wealth}_i + \beta_3 \times \text{Father's Education}_i + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

This asks: 

*"What is the relationship between mother's education and child health, **holding wealth and father's education constant**?"*

---

# Controlling for variables: Intuition

**Without controls:**

"Educated mothers have healthier children."

(But is it education or wealth?)

--

**With wealth controls:**

"Among families with **similar wealth levels**, educated mothers still have healthier children."

--

&lt;br&gt;

By comparing "apples to apples," we get closer to isolating the effect of education.

--

But there's a catch...

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# The Limits of Regression

---

# Why can't we just control for everything?

Regression with controls helps, but it **cannot prove causation**. Here's why:

--

**Problem 1: We can only control for things we can measure**

- What about parenting style? Motivation? Genetics?
- These affect both education and child health, but we can't easily measure them

--

**Problem 2: We can only control for things we think of**

- There may be important factors we haven't even considered

--

**Problem 3: Some factors are impossible to separate**

- Mother's education and her health knowledge are deeply intertwined
- Which one is actually driving the result?

---

# The omitted variable bias problem

When important variables are left in the error term, our estimates can be **biased**.

--

**Biased** means: our estimate of the relationship is systematically wrong.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:**

- True effect of mother's education on child health: **1.0**
- But wealthy families have both more education AND healthier children
- Our regression estimate: **2.1** (too high!)

--

&lt;br&gt;

The extra 1.1 is picking up the effect of wealth, not just education.

--

This is called **omitted variable bias**.

---

# When is omitted variable bias a problem?

Omitted variable bias occurs when:

--

**1.** The omitted variable affects the outcome (child health)

**AND**

**2.** The omitted variable is correlated with our variable of interest (mother's education)

--

&lt;br&gt;

| Omitted variable | Affects child health? | Correlated with mom's education? | Bias? |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| Family wealth | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |
| Child's blood type | No | No | No |
| Local weather | Maybe slightly | No | Minimal |

---

# Today's recap

--

**1. Evidence-based policy** requires rigorous evidence, not just intuition.

--

**2. Correlation ≠ Causation.** Relationships in data don't prove one thing causes another.

--

**3. Confounders** are variables that affect both the cause and outcome, creating misleading associations.

--

**4. Regression** helps us examine relationships and control for some confounders.

--

**5. But regression has limits** — we can't control for things we can't measure or don't think of.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Next session:** How do we actually establish causation? Counterfactual thinking and statistical significance.

# Counterfactual Thinking and Statistical Significance

---

# Quick recap from Monday

--

**The problem:** We want to know if X causes Y, but...

--

- Simple correlations can be misleading (confounders!)
- Regression helps control for **observed** factors
- But we can't control for everything

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Today's question:** If regression isn't enough, how DO we establish causation?

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** We need to think about what would have happened WITHOUT the intervention.
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Counterfactual Thinking

---

# A new example: Microloans for entrepreneurs

Suppose we provide small loans to women entrepreneurs to help them grow their businesses.

--

**Question:** Did the loan program increase business profits?


---

# A new example: Microloans for entrepreneurs


Here's what profits looked like **before** the program started.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/counterfactuals-1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# After the program

Profits are higher after the program. **Success?**

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/counterfactuals-2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Can we conclude the program worked?




---

# The key question

To know if the program worked, we need to ask:

--

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
### What would have happened WITHOUT the program?
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

This is called the **counterfactual** — the outcome that would have occurred in the absence of the intervention.

--

&lt;br&gt;

The counterfactual is the **missing piece** that lets us measure true impact.

---

# The counterfactual problem

We can't observe the counterfactual directly. 
--
**Maybe profits would have looked like this (green line)**:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/counterfactuals-41.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

In this case, the program had a **positive impact** — profits rose more than they would have otherwise.

---

# The counterfactual problem

Or **maybe like this (green line)**?

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/counterfactuals-31.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

In this case, profits would have risen even more — the program had **negative impact**.


---

# The fundamental formula


`$$\text{Program Impact} = \text{What happened} - \text{What would have happened}$$`

--

`$$\text{Impact} = \text{Factual} - \text{Counterfactual}$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

| Scenario | What happened | Counterfactual | Impact |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Program works | Profits = 150 | Would have been 100 | **+50** |
| Program doesn't work | Profits = 150 | Would have been 150 | **0** |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The challenge:** We can never observe the counterfactual directly — we have to **construct** it.

---

# Constructing counterfactuals

Since we can't observe what would have happened, we need a **comparison group**.

--

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Treatment group** | People who received the program |
| **Control group** | Similar people who didn't receive the program |

--

&lt;br&gt;

The control group serves as our **estimate of the counterfactual**.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**The key challenge:** The control group must be truly comparable to the treatment group.
]

---

# Why comparison groups can fail

**Example:** A job training program

--

**Treatment group:** People who signed up for training

**Control group:** People who didn't sign up

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Problem:** People who sign up might be:
- More motivated
- More educated
- More likely to succeed anyway

--

&lt;br&gt;

These differences mean the control group is **not a valid counterfactual**.

---

# The selection problem

This is called **selection bias** — the treatment and control groups differ in ways that affect the outcome.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="./figures/selection_bias.svg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Next week:** We'll learn methods that solve this problem (RCTs, Difference-in-Differences).

---

# Counterfactual thinking: Summary

--

**1.** Impact = What happened − What would have happened without the program

--

**2.** The counterfactual cannot be observed directly

--

**3.** We use comparison groups to estimate the counterfactual

--

**4.** The comparison group must be truly comparable (no selection bias)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This is the foundation of impact evaluation.** Everything else is about constructing valid comparison groups.
]

class: inverse, middle, center

# Statistical Significance

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
How do we know if our results are real?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# A new challenge

Suppose we find that program participants earn **$500 more** than non-participants.

--

**Question:** Is this difference real, or could it be due to random chance?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Analogy:** Flip a coin 10 times and get 7 heads.

- Does this prove the coin is unfair?
- Or could it just be luck?

--

&lt;br&gt;

Statistical tools help us distinguish **real effects** from **random noise**.

---

# Two competing explanations

When we find a difference in our data, there are two possibilities:

--

**Possibility 1: No real effect**
- The difference we see is just random chance
- A different sample might show a different result

--

**Possibility 2: Real effect**
- The difference reflects a genuine impact
- We would see similar results with different samples

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Statistical significance** helps us decide which explanation is more plausible.
]

---

# The null hypothesis

We start by assuming there is **no effect** — this is the **null hypothesis**.

--

Then we ask: *If there truly was no effect, how likely would we see a difference this large just by chance?*

--

&lt;br&gt;

| Term | Plain English |
|------|---------------|
| **Null hypothesis** | "The program has no effect" |
| **Alternative hypothesis** | "The program does have an effect" |

--

&lt;br&gt;

Our goal: Decide whether the evidence is strong enough to **reject** the null hypothesis.

---

# The p-value explained

The **p-value** answers this question:

--

.center[
*If the program truly had no effect, what's the probability of seeing a difference as large as what we found?*
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:**
- We find participants earn $500 more
- The p-value is 0.03 (3%)

--

**Interpretation:** If training had no real effect, there's only a 3% chance we'd see a $500 difference by random chance.

--

Since 3% is small, we conclude the difference is probably **real**, not just luck.

---

# Decision rules

By convention, researchers use these cutoffs:

--

| P-value | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| p &lt; 0.01 | Highly significant (strong evidence) |
| p &lt; 0.05 | Statistically significant |
| p &lt; 0.10 | Marginally significant (weak evidence) |
| p ≥ 0.10 | Not statistically significant |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Important:** "Not significant" does NOT mean "no effect." 

It means we don't have enough evidence to be confident there is an effect.
]

---

# Confidence intervals

Another way to express uncertainty is the **confidence interval**.

--

**Example:**
- Estimated impact: $500 per month
- 95% confidence interval: $150 to $850

--

&lt;br&gt;

**What this means:**
- Our best estimate is $500
- Given uncertainty in our data, the true effect is probably between $150 and $850
- We're fairly confident the true effect falls in this range

---

# Interpreting confidence intervals

**Key insight:** If the confidence interval **includes zero**, we cannot be confident the effect is real.

--

&lt;br&gt;

| 95% Confidence Interval | Interpretation |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| $150 to $850 | Effect is likely positive (doesn't include 0) ✓ |
| −$100 to $800 | Could be positive, zero, or negative ✗ |

--

&lt;br&gt;

Confidence intervals show us:

1. **Whether** the effect is statistically significant (does it include 0?)
2. **How large** the effect might plausibly be

# Reading Regression Output

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Putting it all together with Stata
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Example: Education and consumption

**Research question:** Does household head's education level affect consumption?

--

We run a regression in Stata:
```stata
regress cons_pc i.hh_school
```

--

&lt;br&gt;

This compares consumption across education levels, using "no education" as the reference group.

---

# Stata output

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/reg_poverty.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

--

Let's learn to read this step by step.

---

# Reading the output: Coefficients

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/reg_poverty.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

**Coefficient** = The estimated difference compared to the reference group (no education)

--

- "Primary incomplete": 224.9 higher consumption than no education
- "Primary complete": 594.8 higher consumption than no education

---

# Reading the output: P-values

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/reg_poverty.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

**P&gt;|t|** = The p-value

--

- "Primary incomplete": p = 0.203 (not significant at the 10% level)
- "Primary complete": p = 0.001 (highly significant)

---

# Reading the output: Confidence intervals

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/reg_poverty.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

**[95% Conf. Interval]** = Range of plausible values

--

- "Primary incomplete": [−121.6, 571.3] — includes zero!
- "Secondary complete": [246.3,943.2] — does not include zero

---

# Putting it together

| Education level | Coefficient | P-value | 95% CI | Significant? |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Primary incomplete | 224.9 | 0.203 | [−121.6, 571.3] | No |
| Primary complete | 594.8 | 0.001 | [246.3, 943.2] | Yes |
| Lower secondary | 1498.9 | 0.000 | [1,143.2, 1,854.5 ] | Yes |
| Upper secondary | 2069.4 | 0.000 | [1,623.4, 2,515.4] | Yes |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Interpretation:**
- Completing primary school or higher is associated with significantly higher consumption
- Incomplete primary education shows no statistically significant difference from no education


---

# Writing up results

**Bad:** "Education increases consumption."

--

**Better:** "Completing secondary education is associated with 594.8 pesos higher per capita consumption compared to no education (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI: 246.3 to 943.2)."

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Key elements:**
- Specific comparison (secondary vs. no education)
- Effect size (594.8 pesos)
- Statistical significance (p &lt; 0.001)
- Uncertainty (confidence interval)
- Careful language ("associated with," not "causes")

---

# Common mistakes to avoid

# Main takeaways

--

**1. Evidence-based policy** uses rigorous research to guide decisions, not just intuition.

--

**2. Correlation ≠ Causation.** Confounders can create misleading relationships.

--

**3. Regression** helps examine relationships and control for observed factors, but cannot prove causation.

--

**4. Counterfactual thinking** is essential: Impact = What happened − What would have happened.

--

**5. Comparison groups** help estimate the counterfactual, but must be truly comparable.

--

**6. Statistical significance** (p-values, confidence intervals) tells us if results are likely real or just noise.

---

# Looking ahead

**The big question remains:** How do we construct valid comparison groups?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Next week — Impact Evaluation Methods:**

| Method | Basic idea |
|--------|------------|
| **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** | Randomly assign treatment to create comparable groups |
| **Difference-in-Differences** | Compare changes over time between groups |

--

&lt;br&gt;

These methods give us the tools to establish **causation**, not just correlation.
