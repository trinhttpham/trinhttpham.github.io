When we evaluate whether a policy or program has had an impact, we often begin with a research question. 

- For example: **Did a job training program increase people’s wages?**

--

To answer this, economists and statisticians use hypothesis testing.

--

We need to:

- Step 1: Set up the hypotheses

- Step 2: Use the data to test the hypotheses

---

# The hypotheses

We set up two competing statements:

- Null hypothesis `\((H_0)\)`: The program has no effect on wages.

- Alternative hypothesis `\((H_1)\)`: The program does change wages.

--

**The goal is not to prove the program works.** 

--

Instead, **we test whether the data give us enough reason to reject the idea that it has no effect**.


---

# Evidence and Uncertainty

If we collect data, we might find that participants in the program earn, on average, 10% more than non-participants. 

--

But is this difference because of the program, or could it just be due to random chance in the sample?

--

This is where uncertainty matters. 

--

We cannot know 100% for sure, but we can measure how likely it is that such a difference would appear just by chance.

---

# The p-value 

The p-value answers this question: **If the program really had no effect, what is the probability of observing a difference as large as we found (or larger), just by chance?**

--

If the p-value is small (say, less than 0.05), we conclude it would be very unlikely to see this difference by chance alone.

--

Then we reject the null hypothesis and say the program likely had an effect.

--

If the p-value is not small, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. 

- This doesn’t mean the program has zero effect.

- It just means the evidence is not strong enough to make that conclusion.


---

# Confidence intervals

Another way to express uncertainty is the confidence interval.

--

Suppose we estimate the impact of the training program as a 10% wage increase.

- and the 95% confidence interval is from 3% to 17%.

--

This means we are fairly confident the true impact lies somewhere between 3% and 17%.

--

If the confidence interval includes zero, that suggests we cannot rule out no effect.

--

Confidence intervals are helpful because they show not only whether something is "statistically significant," but also how big the effect might plausibly be.


---

# Summary 

- Hypothesis testing asks: Is there enough evidence to reject the idea of no program impact?

--

- The p-value gives a probability measure of how unusual the data would be if there was no effect.

--

- The confidence interval shows the range of possible true impacts, given the uncertainty.

--

Together, these tools help us make informed statements like:

“The training program increased wages by about 10%, and we are reasonably confident the true effect is positive and between 3% and 17%.”


---

# Application to the poverty data 

We are interested in the relationship between household head's education level and the household consumption per capita.

--

We run the following regression in Stata, and get the results.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/reg_poverty.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 750px;" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Application to the poverty data

Let us focus on the coefficient on **primary incomplete**.

- The coefficient is 224.8728, with p-value of 0.203.

- The 95% confidence interval is [-121.5601, 571.3056].

- Remember, we interpret this coefficient **relative** to the base/reference group of having **no education**.

--

Here, we can state the hypotheses as:

- Null hypothesis `\((H_0)\)`: There is **no difference** in per capita consumption between households whose heads having primary incomplete education and those without education.

- Alternative hypothesis `\((H_1)\)`: There is **difference** in per capita consumption between households whose heads having primary incomplete education and those without education.

---

# Application to the poverty data

Because the p-value is 0.203, which is greater than 0.05:

- We **cannot reject the null hypothesis** of no difference in consumption between these households at the 5% significance level (or at the 95% confidence level).

  - Note that we don't say "We accept the null hypothesis."

- We can also say "the coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% significance level."

--

How we should interpret the 95% confidence interval (95% CI)?

- The 95% confidence interval is [-121.5601, 571.3056].

- It means we are using a method that, over repeated samples, will produce this interval that contain the true difference in consumption between households with some incomplete education and those without education about 95% of the time.

- It does **NOT** mean there is 95% chance that the true parameter is inside this particular interval.

- Because our 95% CI contains 0, we are not confident that the consumption difference is real.
