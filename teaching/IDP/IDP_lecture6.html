# Opening question

Imagine you are a government official with a limited budget to help poor families.

--

You have two options:

--

.pull-left[
**Option A: Give cash**
- Transfer $50/month directly to each family
- They decide how to spend it
]

.pull-right[
**Option B: Give food**
- Provide a food package worth $50/month
- Contains rice, beans, oil, etc.
]


&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Which would you choose? Why?**
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

Today we'll explore the evidence and trade-offs behind this question.

Social Assistance Programs and Targeting
&lt;/div&gt;

# Recap: Types of poverty

In Lecture 2, we classified people into four groups based on their poverty status:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/poor_type.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 

--

Different groups need different types of support.

---

# Matching programs to needs

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/poverty_program.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 

.small[
**Note on terminology:** Transitory poor describes a pattern over time — people who move in and out of poverty. 
- Vulnerable non-poor describes a current status — people above the poverty line right now but at risk of falling below.
]

---

# Programs for the chronic poor

**Goal:** Help people escape poverty permanently

--

**Two main approaches:**

--

**1. Income generation programs** — Help people earn more

- Education and training (build human capital)
- Job creation programs
- Support for small businesses

--

**2. Social assistance programs** — Provide direct support

- Cash transfers
- Food assistance
- School feeding programs
- Healthcare subsidies

---

# Programs for the vulnerable non-poor

**Goal:** Prevent people from falling into poverty

--

These are often **contributory programs** — people pay in when times are good, receive benefits when times are bad.

--

**Examples:**

- Unemployment insurance
- Health insurance
- Pension systems
- Crop insurance for farmers

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Key insight:** Helping the vulnerable non-poor today can prevent them from becoming the chronic poor tomorrow.
]

---

# The policy trade-off

With a limited budget, policymakers face a difficult choice:

--

.pull-left[
**Help the current poor**
- Direct poverty reduction
- Addresses immediate suffering
- But may not prevent future poverty
]

.pull-right[
**Protect the vulnerable**
- Prevents future poverty
- Builds resilience
- But doesn't help those already poor
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

This is sometimes called the **"paradox of social protection"** (Ikegami et al. 2018).

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**There's no single right answer** — it depends on context, resources, and policy priorities.

# The Targeting Challenge

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
How do we identify who should receive benefits?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why is targeting difficult?

**The core problem:** The government doesn't know everyone's true income or needs.

--

This creates **information asymmetry** — potential beneficiaries know more about their situation than the government does.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Two types of errors can occur:**

--

| Error | What happens | Consequence |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Exclusion error** | Truly poor person is denied benefits | Needy people suffer |
| **Inclusion error** | Non-poor person receives benefits | Resources wasted |

--

&lt;br&gt;

There's usually a **trade-off** between these two errors.

---

# Targeting errors visualized

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/targeting_errors.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- **Stricter criteria** → Fewer inclusion errors, but more exclusion errors
- **Looser criteria** → Fewer exclusion errors, but more inclusion errors

---

# Four approaches to targeting

How can governments identify who is poor?

--

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Means testing** | Directly verify income/assets |
| **Proxy means testing** | Use observable characteristics to predict poverty |
| **Community targeting** | Let local communities identify the poor |
| **Self-targeting** | Design programs so only the poor want to participate |

--

&lt;br&gt;

Let's examine each approach.

---

# 1. Means testing

**Idea:** Directly assess each applicant's income and compare to a threshold.

--

**Methods:**
- Check tax records or pay stubs
- Verify bank accounts
- Home visits by officials

--

**Advantages:**
- Directly measures what we care about (income)

--

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive to implement
- Requires good administrative data
- Easy to hide informal income
--

.content-box-yellow[
**Reality check:** In many developing countries, most people work in the informal sector with no official income records.
]

---

# 2. Proxy means testing

**Idea:** Use observable characteristics that correlate with poverty to create a "poverty score."

--

**How it works:**

1. Collect data on things you can easily observe (e.g., housing quality, asset, household composition, education level)

--

2. Use statistical methods (regression) to predict income from these variables

--

3. Assign each household a score; those below a threshold qualify

--

**Advantages:**
- Harder to manipulate than self-reported income
- Can be implemented without formal income records

--

**Disadvantages:**
- Imperfect predictor of true poverty
- May miss the "invisible poor" who look non-poor but are struggling

---

# 3. Community-based targeting

**Idea:** Let local community members identify who is poor.

--

**How it works:**

- Community meetings to identify beneficiaries
- Local leaders provide lists of poor households
- Verification by community members

--

**Advantages:**
- Uses local knowledge
- Low cost
- Can capture dimensions of poverty outsiders miss

--

**Disadvantages:**
- Risk of **elite capture** — local leaders favor friends/family
- Community conflict over who gets benefits
- May reflect local biases or discrimination
- Works best in tight-knit communities

---

# 4. Self-targeting

**Idea:** Design the program so that only poor people want to participate.

--

**How it works:**

--
Make participation unattractive to the non-poor through:

--

- **Waiting costs:** Long lines, inconvenient locations
- **Stigma:** Visible participation may be embarrassing
- **Work requirements:** Must work for benefits
- **Low-quality goods:** Provide basic food, not premium items

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:** Public works programs (workfare)

- Offer employment at wages below the market rate
- Non-poor prefer their regular jobs
- Poor find the wage attractive

---

# Self-targeting example: Seasonal employment

In many rural areas, jobs are scarce during the agricultural off-season.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/fink2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

A **public works program** can provide employment during these lean times.

---

# Designing a workfare program

**The challenge:** How do we set the wage so that:
- Poor people want to participate ✓
- Non-poor people prefer their regular jobs ✓

--


**Simple example:**

| Worker type | Daily wage in regular job |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Poor workers | $5/day |
| Non-poor workers | $12/day |

--


**If the workfare program offers $7/day:**

- Poor workers: "Great! That's better than my $5/day job." → **Will participate**
- Non-poor workers: "No thanks, I make $12/day." → **Won't participate**

--

.content-box-green[
**Self-targeting works!** The wage attracts the poor but not the non-poor.
]

---

# Workfare in practice

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/workfare.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Trade-offs in self-targeting

**Advantages:**
- No need to verify income
- People reveal their own type through choices
- Reduces administrative costs

--

**Disadvantages:**
- Imposes costs on the poor (time, effort, stigma)
- Work requirements may exclude the disabled or elderly
- Some poor may not participate due to stigma

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Key question:** Is it fair to make poor people "prove" their poverty through hardship?
]

---

# Comparing targeting methods

| Method | Cost | Accuracy | Best when... |
|--------|------|----------|--------------|
| Means testing | High | High (if data exists) | Good administrative records |
| Proxy means testing | Medium | Medium | No income data, large program |
| Community targeting | Low | Variable | Tight-knit communities, local trust |
| Self-targeting | Low | Medium | Work-able population, clear wage gaps |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**In practice:** Many programs combine multiple methods.

--

For example: Use proxy means test to identify eligible villages, then community targeting within villages.

---

# Session 1 summary

--

**Social assistance programs** help the poor (direct transfers) and protect the vulnerable (insurance, safety nets).

--

**Targeting is difficult** because governments lack full information about who is truly poor.

--

**Four main approaches:**
- Means testing (verify income directly)
- Proxy means testing (use observable correlates)
- Community targeting (local knowledge)
- Self-targeting (design so only poor want to participate)

--

**Each method has trade-offs** between cost, accuracy, and fairness.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Next:** How should we design the transfers themselves?

# Session 2

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Cash vs. Food Transfers and Conditional Cash Transfers
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The big design questions

Once we've identified beneficiaries, we face two key questions:

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Question 1:**

Should we give **cash** or **food** (in-kind transfers)?
]

.pull-right[
**Question 2:**

Should transfers be **conditional** (must meet requirements) or **unconditional**?
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

These are not just practical questions — they reflect deeper debates about:
- Trusting poor people to make good decisions
- Government's role in shaping behavior
- Efficiency vs. paternalism

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Cash vs. Food Transfers

---

# The case for cash

**Argument:** Poor people know their own needs best.

--

**Why cash might be better:**

--

1. **Flexibility** — Families can buy what they need most
   - Maybe they need medicine, not more rice
   - Maybe they need school fees, not cooking oil

--

2. **Dignity** — Treats recipients as capable adults

--

3. **Efficiency** — No costs of storing/transporting food

--

4. **Market effects** — Cash can stimulate local economies

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Core principle:** If we trust people to know their needs, cash gives them the freedom to address those needs.
]

---

# The case for food

**Argument:** Sometimes we have specific goals, like improving nutrition.

--

**Why food might be better:**

--

1. **Ensures basic needs are met** — Food goes directly to nutrition

--

2. **Protects within household** — Cash might be controlled by one person; food is harder to divert

--

3. **Less fungible** — Harder to spend on alcohol, gambling, etc.

--

4. **Political acceptability** — Voters/donors may prefer "visible" aid

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**The concern:** What if cash is spent on things that don't help the family?
]

---

# What does the evidence say?

Let's look at a real experiment that compared cash and food transfers directly.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Study:** [Cunha, De Giorgi, and Jayachandran (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/86/1/240/4962153?login=true)

**Setting:** Rural Mexico

**Program:** Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL)

---

# The Mexico experiment

**Design:** 300 villages randomly assigned to three groups:

--

| Group | What they received |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Food transfer** | Monthly food package (rice, beans, oil, etc.) |
| **Cash transfer** | Monthly cash payment of equal value |
| **Control** | Nothing (for comparison) |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Key question:** What happens to consumption, nutrition, and local prices?

---

# Group discussion (5 minutes)

Before we look at the results, discuss with your neighbor:

--

1. What do you expect to happen to **local food prices** in villages receiving food transfers?

--

2. What about in villages receiving cash transfers?

--

3. Who benefits and who might be hurt by these price changes?

---

# Results: Effects on prices

| | Food transfer villages | Cash transfer villages |
|--|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Local food prices** | Decreased | Increased |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Why?**

--

- **Food transfers** → More food supply in village → Prices fall

--

- **Cash transfers** → More demand for food → Prices rise

---

# Results: Effects on consumers

| | Food transfers | Cash transfers |
|--|----------------|----------------|
| **Direct benefit** | Receive food | Receive cash |
| **Indirect effect** | Prices fall → can buy more | Prices rise → cash buys less |
| **Net effect on consumption** | Positive | Positive (but smaller) |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Surprising finding:** In this context, **food transfers led to higher calorie consumption** than equivalent cash transfers.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Why?** The price decrease from food transfers gave consumers an extra boost that cash recipients didn't get.
]

---

# But wait — it's more complicated

**What about local food producers?**

--

| | Food transfers | Cash transfers |
|--|----------------|----------------|
| **Food prices** | Fall | Rise |
| **Effect on farmers** | Hurt (lower prices) | Helped (higher prices) |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Cash transfers can stimulate local production:**
- Higher prices → Farmers earn more
- Farmers may invest and produce more
- In the long run, supply increases and prices stabilize

--

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** Cash transfers may have better long-term effects on local economic development.
]

---

# When is cash better? When is food better?

**Cash works well when:**
- Markets function well (goods are available to buy)
- Recipients have diverse needs
- Goal is flexibility and dignity
- Want to stimulate local economy

--

**Food works well when:**
- Markets don't function well (remote areas, emergencies)
- Specific nutritional goals (child nutrition programs)
- Concerns about how cash might be used
- Food prices are very high or volatile

--

.content-box-green[
**There's no universal answer** — the best choice depends on context.
]

---

# What about concerns that cash is "wasted"?

**Common worry:** Won't people spend cash on alcohol, tobacco, or other "temptation goods"?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Evidence from many studies:**

--

- [Evans &amp; Popova (2017)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/689575) reviewed 19 studies across multiple countries

--

- **Finding:** Cash transfers do NOT increase spending on alcohol or tobacco

--

- In fact, some studies find **decreases** in these expenditures

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Bottom line:** The fear that poor people will "waste" cash is largely unfounded.
]

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Conditional vs. Unconditional Transfers

---

# What are conditional cash transfers (CCTs)?

**CCTs** require recipients to meet certain conditions to receive payments.

--

**Common conditions:**

- Children must attend school regularly
- Children must get health check-ups
- Pregnant women must attend prenatal visits
- Adults must attend training programs

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Famous examples:**
- Mexico's PROGRESA/Oportunidades (now Prospera)
- Brazil's Bolsa Família
- Philippines' Pantawid Pamilya

---

# The case for conditions

**Argument:** Conditions can encourage beneficial behaviors.

--

**Why conditions might help:**

--

1. **Correct underinvestment** — Families may not fully appreciate returns to education/health

--

2. **Overcome barriers** — Conditions give families a "reason" to prioritize school

--

3. **Protect children** — Ensures benefits reach children, not just adults

--

4. **Political support** — Easier to justify spending if recipients "do something"

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Paternalistic?** Yes, but maybe justified if it helps children.
]

---

# The case against conditions

**Argument:** Conditions add costs and may exclude the most vulnerable.

--

**Why conditions might hurt:**

--

1. **Exclude the neediest** — What if there's no school nearby? No health clinic?

--

2. **Administrative burden** — Monitoring compliance is expensive

--

3. **Punish the poor** — Losing benefits for missing a check-up seems harsh

--

4. **Disrespectful** — Implies poor people can't make good decisions

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Alternative view:** If people would send kids to school anyway, why add conditions?
]

---

# Evidence: Malawi schooling experiment

**Study:** [Baird, McIntosh, and Özler (2011)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/126/4/1709/1922509?login=true)

**Setting:** Malawi, targeting girls ages 13-22

--

**Design:** Schools randomly assigned to three groups:

| Group | What they received |
|-------|-------------------|
| **CCT** | Cash transfer IF attending school |
| **UCT** | Cash transfer with NO conditions |
| **Control** | No transfer |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Key question:** Do conditions improve outcomes, or are they unnecessary?

---

# Results: School attendance

| | CCT vs. Control | UCT vs. Control |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Additional school days per term** | +4 days | +2 days |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Interpretation:** Both CCT and UCT increased attendance, but **CCT had a larger effect**.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**For school attendance, conditions helped.**
]

---

# Results: Test scores

| | CCT vs. Control | UCT vs. Control |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| **English test scores** | +0.14 standard deviations | No significant effect |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Interpretation:** **Only CCT improved learning outcomes.**

--

&lt;br&gt;

This makes sense: CCT kept girls in school more consistently, leading to better learning.

---

# But here's the surprise...

**What about teenage pregnancy and marriage?**

--

| | CCT vs. Control | UCT vs. Control |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Teenage pregnancy** | No significant change | **↓ 27%** |
| **Teenage marriage** | No significant change | **↓ 44%** |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Wait — UCT reduced pregnancy and marriage, but CCT didn't?**

---

# Understanding the surprising result

**Why did UCT reduce pregnancy and marriage more than CCT?**

--

**Key insight:** Girls who dropped out of school still received UCT money.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/malawi_marriage.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/malawi-too-young-to-get-married?lang=en"&gt;Source: Equal Times&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The mechanism: Economic pressure

In Malawi (and many countries), **early marriage is partly an economic decision**.

--

- Poor families may see marriage as a way to reduce expenses
- Bride price provides immediate income
- One less person to feed

--

&lt;br&gt;

**UCT relaxed this economic pressure** for ALL girls, including dropouts.

--

**CCT only helped girls who stayed in school** — dropouts lost benefits and faced the same economic pressures.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**The poorest, most vulnerable girls** — those who couldn't stay in school — benefited most from UCT.
]

---

# Summary: CCT vs. UCT trade-offs

| Outcome | CCT | UCT |
|---------|-----|-----|
| School attendance | ✓ Larger effect | ✓ Smaller effect |
| Learning (test scores) | ✓ Improved | ✗ No effect |
| Teenage pregnancy | ✗ No effect | ✓ Reduced |
| Teenage marriage | ✗ No effect | ✓ Reduced |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**There's no clear winner** — CCT and UCT have different strengths.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

**CCT** is better for keeping kids in school and improving learning.

**UCT** is better for reaching the most vulnerable and reducing economic desperation.

---

# When to use CCT vs. UCT?

**CCT works well when:**
- Goal is specifically to increase school/health clinic attendance
- Services (schools, clinics) are available and accessible
- Monitoring is feasible
- Beneficiaries wouldn't use services otherwise

--

**UCT works well when:**
- Services are not accessible to everyone
- Goal is general poverty reduction and protection
- Monitoring is expensive or impractical
- Want to reach the most marginalized

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Hybrid approaches:** Some programs use "soft" conditions (encouraged but not enforced) or "labeled" transfers (suggest how to use, but don't require).

---

# Main takeaways

--

**Targeting** is challenging because governments lack full information about who is poor. Different methods (means testing, proxy means testing, community targeting, self-targeting) have different trade-offs.

--

**Cash vs. food transfers:**
- Cash offers flexibility and dignity
- Food may work better when markets are weak or nutrition is the specific goal
- Evidence does NOT support fears that cash is "wasted"

--

**CCT vs. UCT:**
- CCT can increase specific behaviors (school attendance)
- UCT reaches the most vulnerable and may have broader protective effects
- The best choice depends on program goals and context

--

**No single approach is always best** — effective social assistance requires understanding local conditions and making context-appropriate choices.

---

# Discussion questions

1. In your country or a country you know well, what targeting method would work best? Why?

--

2. If you were designing a program for poor rural families, would you choose cash or food? What factors would influence your decision?

--

3. Should cash transfers to families with children have conditions attached? What are the ethical considerations?
