class: inverse

Education and health are intrinsically important as basic needs. 

--

They are also important instruments for development and economic growth.

--

- e.g., contributing to raising labor productivity and  entrepreneurship quality, and hence the levels of wage and income

--

Some key questions that arise in studying educational services are:

--

- Why are educational services under-provided?
  
--

- What can be done to improve the level, quality and equity of services?

  Why are education under-provided?
&lt;/div&gt;

# Why are education under-provided?

From an economic perspective, several key reasons explain why markets alone may fail to provide enough education:

--

**Positive externalities**:

--

- Education benefits not only individuals but also society—higher productivity, innovation, better health, civic participation. 

--

- These spillover benefits are not fully captured by private returns, reducing incentives for individuals and markets to invest optimally in education.

--

**Public good characteristics**:

--

- Education has elements of a public good—especially knowledge and human capital spillovers—which are non-exclusive and partially non-rivalrous. 

--

  - Note that while individual schooling is excludable and rivalrous (limited seats and resources), the societal benefits of education have important public good features.
  
--

- This can lead to under-investment as private providers may not recover full costs.

--

This creates a strong case for government intervention to fund and expand education, ensuring broad access and maximizing social returns.


---

class: inverse 

This week, we will explore the crucial topic of education, focusing on three key areas:

--

Education Indicators

- What are the key metrics used to measure educational outcomes?


--

Determinants of Educational Decisions:

- What factors influence whether children attend school, stay enrolled, and perform well?

- How do household, community, and policy environments shape education choices?

--

Effective Policy Interventions:

- What does empirical evidence tell us about programs that successfully improve education outcomes?

- We will review interventions such as cash transfers and teacher incentives.

# Gross Enrollment Rate (GER)

GER is the ratio of the number of children enrolled in a given school category (primary, secondary, or tertiary) to the number of children in the age group that officially corresponds to that level of schooling.

--

`$$GER = (\frac{\text{Total number of children enrolled at a given level of education}}{\text{Total number of children of official age}})\times 100\%$$`

--

The gross enrollment rate can be *greater than 100%*. 

--
Is this a good sign? 

--
Might be not. Grade repetition.

--

While enrollment rates have increased globally, huge disparities exist across countries, genders, income levels, and rural/urban

---

---

# Net Enrollment Rate (NER)

Net Enrollment Rate (NER) is the percentage of children of the official age group for a given education level (e.g., primary, secondary, or tertiary) who are enrolled in that level of education.

--

`$$NER = (\frac{\text{Number of children of official age enrolled}}{\text{Total number of children of official age}})\times 100\%$$`

--

Can NER be greater than 100%? 

--

NER is typically used as a better indicator of whether children of the correct age are actually attending school.

- while GER can sometimes be misleading if there is a large number of students older or younger than the official age group.

---

# Net Enrollment Rate (NER)

NER can be represented in school-enrollment pyramids by age and proportion of the population in each level of schooling.

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  What determines the levels of schooling?
&lt;/div&gt; 



---

# Schooling decisions

How do people decide whether to go to school?

--

Going to school isn’t just about attending classes — it’s a decision about **weighing costs and benefits**.

--

Let’s think about what people consider:

--

- Benefits: 

  - Enjoyment of learning
  
  - Expectation that more education will lead to better-paying jobs in the future.

--

- Costs: 

  - Money spent on tuition, books, travel.

  - Lost income or time helping family instead of working.
  
--

People compare these trade-offs and choose school when **benefits outweigh costs**.

---

# Summarizing the decision mathematically

We can write the total benefits as:

`$$\text{Total benefits} = i + \delta(w_1 - w_0)$$`

--

- `\(i\)` Intrinsic value or enjoyment from going to school

--

- `\(\delta\)`: Discount factor — how much you value future earnings today (less than 1 if you prefer money sooner)

--

- `\(w_1\)`: Expected future wages if educated.

- `\(w_0\)`: Current wages or income forgone by attending school instead of working.

--

Similarly, the total cost can be written as: 

`$$\text{Total costs} = c + w_0$$`
- `\(c\)`: Direct costs of schooling like tuition, uniforms, books, and travel


---

# The schooling decision

If 

`$$i + \delta(w_1 - w_0) &gt; c + w_0$$`

then it makes sense to go to school.

--

Many children don’t attend school because total costs outweigh benefits.

--

Policies can improve schooling by:

--

- Reducing direct costs (like free textbooks or transport)

--

- Increasing expected future benefits (like improving school quality or job opportunities)

--

- Compensating for opportunity costs (like cash transfers to families for lost income)

--

- Or simply correcting people's mis-perception of the expected future benefits of schooling.

--

These policies can be classified as supply-side or demand-side interventions.

&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Supply-side determinants: school construction

Between 1974 and 1979, one primary school was added for every 500 children ages 5 to 14.

--

School enrollment increased from 69% to 83%. 

--

The challenge with impact evaluation of this program: more schools were constructed in poorer districts.

--

Thus, we cannot do a simple difference between high-intensity versus low-intensity districts.

--

Why?

--
That will lead us to compare poorer districts versus wealthier districts.

--

Duflo (2001) addresses this using Difference-in-Differences.

--

What is the key asssumption for DiD to capture the causal effect of school construction?


---

# Supply-side determinants: school construction

The key assumption is that the change over time (i.e. between different cohorts) in average years of education would have been the same in both high-intensity and low-density areas of the country had the program not been implemented.

--

*Pre-trend* assumption is verified by comparing the educational achievements of two cohorts that attended primary school prior to the program: those who were aged 12–17 in 1974 and those 18–24 in 1974.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/did_duflo.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

`$$ATE_{DiD} = (8.49 - 8.02) - (9.76 - 9.4) = 0.11 \quad \text{years of education}$$`



---

# Supply-side determinants: teacher quality

There is an intense debate about educational quality in India.

--

On one hand, subsidizing enrollment in low-cost private schools may offer a potential escape from the deficiencies of public schooling, for example chronic teacher absenteeism. 

--

On the other hand, private schools may present their own set of issues, so fixing what is wrong in public schools may be the more prudent approach.

--

Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011) propose an innovative **attempt to improve the quality of public education** through **performance-based teacher pay**.

---

# Supply-side determinants: teacher quality

They conducted a RCT in rural primary schools in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. 

--

The study randomly assigned schools to three different groups:

--

- Teacher Performance Pay Group (G1): Teachers' bonuses were tied to improvements in their students' test scores.

--

- School Incentives Group (G2): Teachers' bonuses were tied to the test score improvement of all incentivized teachers in the school.

--

- Control Group: No intervention, representing the status quo.

--

What would you expect regarding the impact of these interventions? Why did they do both G1 and G2?

--

They find that both teacher performance schemes can improve both teacher effort (worked longer hours, spent more time on teaching, and provided more individualized attention to students) and student learning (test scores).

--

- Some evidence that individual incentive is more effective than group incentive.


---

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Demand-side education interventions
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Demand-side determinants: opportunity costs

Atkins (2016) studies how the growth in less-skilled export-manufacturing jobs affect schooling in Mexico.

--

He uses a rollout design based on the timing of factory openings:

--

  - comparing the schooling decisions of younger cohorts who became eligible to dropout after the factory opened
 vs. slightly older cohorts
 
--

He found that for every 25 new jobs created, one student dropped out at grade 9 rather than continuing through grade 12.

--

This confirms that increases in opportunity cost `\(w_0\)` indeed reduce the demand for schooling and increase dropouts.

---

# Demand-side determinants: expected returns

In Dominican Republic: 85% completion rate for primary school (8th grade) but only 30% completion rate for high school.

--

Students were asked about perceived wages for those who had completed primary school vs. those who had completed high school.
  
--

They believed that the returns were about 2% per year (or 9% increase in wages if moving from 8th grade to 12th grade).

--

However, Jensen (2010) estimated that the "true" returns are about 10% per year.

  - or 40% for going from 8th grade to high school.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/return3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Demand-side determinants: expected returns

Jensen (2010) conducted an RCT, randomly assign schools to two groups:

--

- Treatment schools: Students were informed about the "true" returns 

  - 10% per year, or 40% for going from 8th grade to high school.
  
--
  
- Control schools: No intervention, representing the status quo.

--

Jensen found that correcting beliefs increased average education by 0.2 years of schooling.

--

But the effects are heterogeneous across wealth groups:

  - No change in average education for children from poor households.
  
  - This suggests credit constraints.
  
  
---

# Demand-side determinants: cash transfers

The Mexican's PROGRESA program is a conditional cash transfer.

--

It pays poor rural mothers to send their children to school (without missing more than 3 days/month, as certified by the teacher) and meet health requirements (vaccinations and regular health check-ups).

--

The design of this program is consistent with the predictions of the model developed above:

--

- The opportunity cost of schooling is highest for secondary-school children ($w_0$ is larger), hence transfers increase with the grade.

--

- Poor people are more constrained by school costs `\(c\)` and have higher discount rates, hence the program targets households below the poverty line.

--

- The benefits of schooling `\((w_1-w_0)\)` tend to be lower in rural areas, hence the program is targeted on rural areas to induce more schooling.

--

- Parents may value boys' education over girls' (either because of boy preference or because boys are more likely to participate in the formal-sector labor force), hence a larger transfer is offered to girls to induce parents to send them to school just as they would boys.


---

# Demand-side determinants: cash transfers

The main effect of the PROGRESA transfer is to significantly increase enrollment in secondary school.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/progresa.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Demand-side determinants: cash transfers

The impact of PROGRESA is heterogeneous across the population. The impact is larger with:
  
- closeness to school (lower `\(c\)`)
  
- the educational level of parents (higher `\(i\)`)

- the job experience of the father in valuing education (low response among farm workers for whom education has little relevance, and hence have a low expected `\(w_1-w_0\)` gain for their children)

  Do you have any questions? 
&lt;/div&gt; 



---

# Main Takeaways

- Education is a multifaceted process that can be measured through multiple complementary indicators.

--

- Schooling choices balance benefits (enjoyment + future earnings) against costs (direct + opportunity).

--

Many children do not attend school because the costs outweigh the perceived benefits.

--

Policies to improve schooling can be classified as supply-side or demand-side interventions, including:

- Reducing costs (free supplies, schools)

- Raising expected returns (better school quality, information)

- Offsetting opportunity costs (cash transfers)

--

Rigorous impact evaluation is essential to determine whether a policy effectively increases schooling.
