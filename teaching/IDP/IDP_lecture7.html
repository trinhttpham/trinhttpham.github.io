# Opening question

A 14-year-old girl in rural Mexico faces a choice:

--

.pull-left[
**Option A: Stay in school**
- Continue to 9th grade
- No immediate income
- Maybe get a better job later?
]

.pull-right[
**Option B: Work in a factory**
- Earn $5/day starting now
- Help family pay bills immediately
- But what about the future?
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**What would influence her decision? What could policy do to keep her in school?**
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

Today we'll explore why children drop out and what works to keep them in school.

# Session 1

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Understanding Education
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why does education matter?

Education is important for two reasons:

--

**1. Intrinsic value**

- Education is a basic human need
- People value learning for its own sake

--

**2. Instrumental value**

- Education increases productivity and wages
- More educated workers → economic growth
- Better health, civic participation, innovation

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** Education benefits not just individuals but society as a whole.
]

---

# Why is education under-provided?

If education is so valuable, why don't markets provide enough of it?

--

**Positive externalities**: Education benefits society (innovation, health, civic participation)

- But individuals only consider their *private* benefits when deciding
- Result: People invest less in education than what's best for society

--

**Credit constraints**: Education requires upfront costs but pays off later

- Poor families can't borrow against future earnings
- Result: Talented poor children can't afford school

--

**Information problems**: Families may not know the true returns to education
- Result: Under-investment due to underestimating benefits

--

.content-box-yellow[
**This creates a strong case for government intervention** — subsidies, public schools, information campaigns.
]

# Education Indicators

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
How do we measure educational outcomes?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Gross Enrollment Rate (GER)

**GER** measures total enrollment relative to the school-age population:

`$$GER = \frac{\text{Total children enrolled at a level}}{\text{Children of official age for that level}} \times 100\%$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Can GER be greater than 100%?**

--

Yes! This happens when:
- Older students repeat grades
- Students start school late

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**A GER above 100% is often NOT a good sign** — it may indicate high grade repetition rates.
]

---

# GER: Global disparities

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gross-enrollment-ratio-in-primary-education?tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# GER: Gender gaps

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-education-levels?tab=line" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Net Enrollment Rate (NER)

**NER** is more precise — it counts only children of the correct age:

`$$NER = \frac{\text{Children of official age enrolled at that level}}{\text{Total children of official age}} \times 100\%$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Can NER be greater than 100%?**

--

No — by definition, the numerator can't exceed the denominator.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**NER is generally a better indicator** of whether children are in school at the right time.
]

---

# NER: Visualizing enrollment by age

NER can be shown as school-enrollment pyramids:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/nepal.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**What this shows:** The proportion of children at each age enrolled in each level of schooling in Nepal.

---

# NER: Global disparities

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-net-enrollment-rate-in-primary-education?time=2024&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# NER: Gender gaps in pre-primary

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/net-enrollment-pre-primary-boys-vs-girls?tab=chart" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Other important indicators

**Out-of-school children:** Number of children not enrolled at all

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/girls-and-boys-of-primary-school-age-who-are-out-of-school?tab=chart" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 420px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Educational attainment

**Years of schooling:** Average completed years for adults over 25

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-years-of-schooling?tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 450px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Completion rates

**Grade completion rate:** Share of children who actually finish a given level

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/completion-rate-of-primary-education?tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 450px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Quality vs. quantity

**Learning outcomes:** Do children actually learn in school?

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/quality-vs-quantity-of-schooling?tab=chart" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 450px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Summary: Education indicators

| Indicator | What it measures | Limitation |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **GER** | Total enrollment / age-group population | Can exceed 100% (grade repetition) |
| **NER** | Correct-age enrollment / age-group | Misses over-age students |
| **Out-of-school** | Children not enrolled | Doesn't capture dropouts |
| **Attainment** | Years of schooling completed | Doesn't measure learning |
| **Completion rate** | Who finishes each level | Doesn't measure learning |
| **Test scores** | Actual learning | Hard to compare across contexts |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Key insight:** Enrollment ≠ Attendance ≠ Learning. We need multiple indicators.

# What Determines Schooling?

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Why do some children go to school while others don't?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# The schooling decision

Going to school is a decision about **weighing costs and benefits**.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Benefits of school:**

- Enjoyment of learning
- Higher wages in the future
- Better job opportunities
- Social connections
]

.pull-right[
**Costs of school:**

- Tuition, books, uniforms
- Transportation
- Lost income from not working
- Time that could help family
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Simple rule:** Children go to school when **benefits &gt; costs**.
]

---

# Why don't some children attend school?

**The costs are too high:**
- School fees, supplies, transport are unaffordable
- Family needs the child's labor or income

--

**The benefits seem too low:**
- Poor school quality → limited learning
- Few job opportunities even with education
- Parents don't know the true returns to schooling

--

**Other barriers:**
- Schools are too far away
- Safety concerns (especially for girls)
- Cultural norms against educating girls
- Health problems, disabilities

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Policy can address each of these barriers** — that's what we'll explore in Session 2.
]

---

# Returns to schooling: What's the payoff?

**Returns to schooling** = How much more you earn with additional education

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/return.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**What this table shows:** Each additional year of schooling increases wages by about 10% on average. 

- Returns are often higher for women than men.

---

# Returns vary by education level

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/return2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**What this shows:** Returns to education by level (primary, secondary, tertiary) and gender. 

- Tertiary education has the highest returns (15-17%), but secondary has lower returns (7-9%).

---

# Returns vary by region

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/return3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 750px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key patterns:**
- Returns are generally **higher in developing regions** (Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America)
- **Primary education** has very high returns in low-income regions (14-16%)
- **Women often have higher returns** than men at most levels

---

# Why returns to schooling matter for policy

If returns are high but enrollment is low, something is preventing children from going to school.

--

**Possible barriers:**

| Barrier | Policy response |
|---------|-----------------|
| Families don't know returns are high | Information campaigns |
| Can't afford school costs | Subsidies, free schooling |
| Need child's income now | Cash transfers |
| No schools nearby | Build more schools |
| Schools are low quality | Teacher training, incentives |

--

.content-box-green[
**This is the framework for Session 2:** Matching policies to barriers.
]

---

# Session 1 summary

--

**Education is under-provided** because of externalities, credit constraints, and information problems.

--

**Multiple indicators** measure education: enrollment (GER, NER), completion, attainment, and learning.

--

**Schooling decisions** weigh benefits (future wages, enjoyment) against costs (fees, lost income).

--

**Returns to schooling are high** — about 10% per year on average — but many children still don't attend.

--

**Policy can help** by reducing costs, increasing benefits, or removing barriers.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Next:** What specific policies work?

# Session 2

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Policy Interventions
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Two types of interventions

Policies to improve education can be classified as:

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
**Supply-side interventions**

Increase the availability or quality of schools:
- Build more schools
- Hire more teachers
- Improve teacher quality
- Provide textbooks/materials
]

.pull-right[
**Demand-side interventions**

Increase families' willingness/ability to send children:
- Reduce school costs
- Cash transfers
- Provide information about returns
- Address opportunity costs
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Both matter** — the best approach depends on what barriers exist in a given context.
]

---

# Supply-Side Interventions

---

# Supply-side factors

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/supply1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Supply-side factors (continued)

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/supply2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Evidence: School construction in Indonesia

**Recall from Lecture 5:** Duflo (2001) studied Indonesia's massive school construction program (1974-1979).

--

**The program:** One new primary school for every 500 children aged 5-14.

--

**The challenge:** More schools were built in poorer districts — can't simply compare high vs. low construction areas.

--

**The solution:** Difference-in-Differences

- Compare younger cohorts (who benefited) vs. older cohorts (who didn't)
- Across high-construction vs. low-construction regions

--

**Finding:** The program increased education by about **0.11 years** on average.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Building schools works** — but the effect was modest. What else might help?
]

---

# Evidence: Teacher incentives in India

**The problem:** Teacher absenteeism is chronic in many developing countries.

--

**The question:** Can performance-based pay improve teacher effort and student learning?

--

**Study:** Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011) — RCT in rural India

--

**Design:** Schools randomly assigned to:

| Group | Intervention |
|-------|--------------|
| **Individual incentives** | Teacher bonus based on *own students'* test score improvement |
| **Group incentives** | Teacher bonus based on *all teachers'* improvement in the school |
| **Control** | No bonus (status quo) |

---

# Results: Teacher incentives

**What happened?**

--

**Teacher behavior changed:**
- Teachers worked longer hours
- Spent more time actually teaching
- Gave more individual attention to students

--

**Student learning improved:**
- Both incentive schemes raised test scores
- Individual incentives were slightly more effective than group incentives

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Teacher incentives can work** — but they need to be well-designed and monitored.
]

---

# Demand-Side Interventions

---

# Demand-side barrier: Opportunity costs

**Study:** [Atkin (2016) — Mexico](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20120901)

--

**Question:** What happens to schooling when factory jobs become available?


--

**Method:** Use variation in the **timing of factory openings across commuting zones**.

--

**Finding:** For every 25 new factory jobs created, **one student dropped out** at grade 9 instead of continuing to grade 12.

--

&lt;br&gt; 

.content-box-yellow[
**When work opportunities improve, some children leave school** — the opportunity cost of staying in school increased.
]

--

&lt;br&gt; 

**Policy implication:** Cash transfers can offset this by compensating families for lost income.

---

# Demand-side barrier: Misperceptions about returns

**Study:** [Jensen (2010) — Dominican Republic](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/125/2/515/1882172)

--

**The puzzle:**
- 85% of students complete primary school (8th grade)
- But only 30% complete high school

--

**Why?** Jensen surveyed students about their beliefs:

| | Students believed | Actual returns |
|--|-------------------|----------------|
| **Return per year of school** | ~2% | ~10% |
| **Gain from 8th → 12th grade** | ~9% higher wages | ~40% higher wages |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Students dramatically underestimated the benefits of staying in school.**
]

---

# Can information change behavior?

**Jensen's experiment:**

--

| Group | Intervention |
|-------|--------------|
| **Treatment** | Students told the "true" returns (~10% per year) |
| **Control** | No information (status quo) |

--

**Results:**
- Correcting beliefs increased average education by **0.2 years**

--

**But the effects varied:**
- **Wealthier students:** Responded to information, stayed in school longer
- **Poorer students:** No change — they already knew school was valuable but couldn't afford it

--

.content-box-green[
**Information helps, but only when families can act on it.** Poor families also need financial support.
]

---

# Demand-side solution: Cash transfers

**Recall from Lecture 6:** Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) pay families to send children to school.

--

**Mexico's PROGRESA program:**
- Pays poor rural mothers if children attend school (≤3 absences/month)
- Transfers increase with grade level (higher opportunity cost for older children)
- Girls receive larger transfers than boys

--

**Why this design makes sense:**

| Design feature | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------|
| Transfers increase by grade | Offset higher opportunity costs for older children |
| Target poor households | They face the largest cost barriers |
| Focus on rural areas | Lower expected returns to education |
| Higher transfers for girls | Parents may undervalue girls' education |

---

# PROGRESA: Results

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/progresa.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Main finding:** PROGRESA significantly increased secondary school enrollment, especially for girls.

---

# PROGRESA: Heterogeneous effects

The impact of PROGRESA varied across families:

--

**Larger effects when:**
- Schools were closer (lower direct costs)
- Parents were more educated (valued education more)

--

**Smaller effects when:**
- Fathers worked in farming (lower expected returns to education)

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Cash transfers work best when other barriers are also low** — they're most effective when combined with accessible, quality schools.
]

---

# Comparing interventions

&lt;br&gt;

| Intervention | What it addresses | Evidence |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Build schools** | Access/distance | Works, but modest effects |
| **Teacher incentives** | Quality | Can improve learning |
| **Information campaigns** | Misperceptions | Helps those who can afford school |
| **Cash transfers** | Cost barriers | Strong effects on enrollment |
| **Free uniforms/supplies** | Direct costs | Can increase attendance |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**No single intervention is always best** — the right approach depends on what barriers exist locally.
]

---

# The policy design process

**Step 1:** Diagnose the problem
- Why aren't children in school in this context?
- Is it cost? Distance? Quality? Beliefs?

--

**Step 2:** Match intervention to barrier
- Cost barrier → Cash transfers, subsidies
- Distance barrier → Build schools
- Quality barrier → Teacher training, incentives
- Information barrier → Campaigns about returns

--

**Step 3:** Evaluate impact
- Use rigorous methods (RCTs, DiD) to measure what works
- Adjust based on evidence

--

.content-box-yellow[
**This is evidence-based policy** — the approach we've been learning throughout this course.
]

---

# Main takeaways

--

**Education is under-provided** due to externalities, credit constraints, and information problems — justifying government intervention.

--

**Multiple indicators** measure education (enrollment, completion, learning), and they don't always move together.

--

**Schooling decisions** balance benefits (future wages) against costs (fees, opportunity costs).

--

**Supply-side interventions** (schools, teachers) increase availability and quality.

--

**Demand-side interventions** (cash transfers, information) help families overcome barriers.

--

**Context matters** — the best policy depends on what barriers exist locally.

--

**Rigorous evaluation** is essential to know what works.

---

# Discussion questions

1. In your country, what do you think is the main barrier to education — cost, distance, quality, or something else?

--

2. Should cash transfers for education be conditional (require attendance) or unconditional? What are the trade-offs?

--

3. How should policymakers balance investing in school quantity (more schools) vs. quality (better teachers)?
