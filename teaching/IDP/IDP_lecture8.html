# Opening question

In rural India, public health clinics are **free**.

--

Yet most people **pay out of pocket** to see private doctors.

--

Here's the puzzle:

--

.pull-left[
**Public clinics**
- Free services
- Government-funded
- Should serve the poor
]

.pull-right[
**Private "doctors"**
- Charge fees
- 82% have no medical training
- Often prescribe unnecessary drugs
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Why would poor families pay for unqualified private care when free public care exists?**

Today we'll explore what's broken in health systems and what works to fix them.

# Session 1

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Understanding Health
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# What is health?

Health is a form of human capital — but it's complex and multidimensional.

--

**WHO definition:** 

&gt; "A state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity."

--

&lt;br&gt;

This means:
- Health is more than just "not being sick"
- It includes mental and social dimensions
- It's difficult to measure with a single indicator

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**We need multiple indicators** to characterize the health status of a population.
]

---

# Why is health under-provided?

Like education, markets alone fail to provide enough health services.

--

**Positive externalities**
- Vaccinating one person protects others (herd immunity)
- Treating infectious diseases reduces spread
- Healthier workers → more productive economy

--

**Public good characteristics**
- Disease control benefits everyone
- Knowledge about health is non-rivalrous

--

**Market failures**
- Private providers may not serve poor/remote areas
- Information asymmetries between doctors and patients
- Credit constraints prevent investment in health

--

**Strong case for government intervention** — but as we'll see, public systems often fail too.

---

# Health Indicators

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
How do we measure population health?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Life expectancy at birth

**Definition:** Average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming current mortality rates continue.

--

This is the most commonly used indicator of overall population health.

--

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't measure quality of life during those years
- Doesn't capture the WHO definition of "wellbeing"

--

&lt;br&gt;

Life expectancy has increased dramatically worldwide — but huge disparities remain.

---

# Life expectancy: Global patterns

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography?tab=map&amp;time=1978&amp;hideControls=true&amp;indicator=Life+expectancy&amp;Sex=Both+sexes&amp;Age=Under+1+year&amp;Projection+scenario=High&amp;country=CHN~IND~USA~IDN~PAK~NGA~BRA~JPN" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE)

**HALE** accounts for quality, not just quantity of life: `\(HALE = \text{Life expectancy} - \text{Years lost to disability and disease}\)`

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/healthy-life-expectancy-at-birth?time=latest&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Infant mortality rate

**IMR**: infants are most vulnerable to health conditions. IMR responds quickly to changes in health environment.

--

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/infant-mortality?tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Burden of disease (DALYs)

**DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) measure years of "good" life lost due to: premature death and living with disability or illness

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/dalys-rate-from-all-causes?tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Burden of disease: Driven by child health

The global decrease in disease burden is mostly driven by improvements in **child health**.

# Hunger and malnutrition indicators

| Indicator | What it measures | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **Daily calorie intake** | Food consumption | Based on recall/diaries |
| **Micronutrient deficiencies** | Iron, zinc, vitamin A levels | Requires blood tests; "hidden hunger" |
| **Stunting** | Height-for-age | Reflects long-term/early malnutrition |
| **Wasting** | Weight-for-height | Reflects current nutritional status |
| **BMI** | Weight/height² | General nutritional status |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Multiple indicators needed** — someone can have adequate calories but still suffer micronutrient deficiencies.
]

---

# Summary: Health indicators

| Indicator | What it captures | Limitation |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **Life expectancy** | Overall mortality | Not quality of life |
| **HALE** | Healthy years lived | Complex to calculate |
| **Infant mortality** | Health system quality | Only captures one age group |
| **DALYs** | Disease burden | Data-intensive |
| **Anthropometrics** | Nutritional status | Doesn't capture all health dimensions |

--

&lt;br&gt;

# Supply-Side Determinants

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Why do health systems fail?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Supply-side challenges in developing countries

Health systems in poor countries face major obstacles:

--

**Resource constraints**
- Weak fiscal resources for public health
- Low availability of qualified medical personnel
- Inadequate infrastructure (clinics, equipment)

--

**Personnel problems**
- Difficulty attracting qualified doctors to rural areas
- High absenteeism among public health workers
- Low motivation and accountability

--

**Targeting challenges**
- Difficulty ensuring free services reach the poor
- Elite capture of public resources

--

Let's examine a detailed case study from India.

---

# Case study: Health care in rural Rajasthan

**Study:** Banerjee, Deaton, and Duflo (2004)

**Setting:** Udaipur district, one of the poorest in India
- Large tribal population
- Unusually high female illiteracy
- 100 villages, ~1000 households surveyed

--

**Research questions:**
1. What is the health status of rural populations?
2. How do people access health care?
3. Why don't people use free public facilities?

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Although the data are from 2002-2003, the lessons remain highly relevant today.**
]

---

# Finding 1: Health status is poor

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key findings:**
- **BMI:** 88% of women and 93% of men have BMI below 21 (average = 18)
- **Respiratory problems:** Average peak flow of 316 ml (below 350 indicates difficulty)
- **Anemia:** 56% of women and 51% of men are anemic

---

# Finding 2: People rarely use public facilities

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key findings:**
- Households visit health facilities about once every two months
- **Most visits are to private facilities**, not public ones
- Surprisingly, **the poor use public facilities even less** than the non-poor

---

# Finding 3: Health is a major expense

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key finding:** A high share of household budget goes to health — **even among the poorest families**.

---

# The puzzle

**Why don't people use the free public health system?**

--

On paper, India has an ideal public health structure:

| Level | Coverage | Services |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Sub-center** | 1 per 3,000 people | Nurse provides preventive care, referrals |
| **Primary Health Center (PHC)** | 1 per 50,000 people | Basic treatment |
| **Community/District Hospital** | Regional | Serious cases |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**This looks good on paper — but what's the reality?**
]

---

# Reality: Massive absenteeism

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health5.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Shocking findings:**
- **56% of sub-centers** had doors closed when surveyors visited
- **45%** had no personnel found at all
- Even at larger facilities, **78%** had at least one medical staff missing

---

# Reality: Private sector is unregulated

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health4.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Among private "doctors" surveyed:**
- **8%** had not graduated from class 10 (high school)
- **18%** had no medical or paramedical training
- **82%** had no medical training whatsoever

---

# The vicious cycle

**Why are public facilities empty and staff absent?**

--

Two reinforcing explanations:

--

**1. Patients are discouraged by absenteeism**
- If nurses are often absent, why bother going?
- Patients switch to private providers (even if unqualified)

--

**2. Staff are discouraged by low patient numbers**
- If few patients come, why show up?
- No accountability, no consequences for absence

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**These two problems reinforce each other** — creating a downward spiral in public health care quality.
]

---

# Session 1 summary

--

**Health is multidimensional** — we need multiple indicators (life expectancy, infant mortality, DALYs, nutrition measures).

--

**Health systems are under-provided** due to externalities, public good characteristics, and market failures.

--

**Supply-side challenges** in developing countries include resource constraints, personnel problems, and weak accountability.

--

**The Udaipur case study** reveals:
- Poor health status despite available public facilities
- Massive absenteeism in public clinics
- People pay for unqualified private care instead
- A vicious cycle of low demand and low supply quality

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Next:** What can be done to fix these problems?

# Supply-Side Solutions

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Can we fix public health care?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Solution: Community monitoring in Uganda

**The problem:** Uganda's health centers had 47% staff absence rate in 2004.

--

**The intervention:** Björkman and Svensson (2009) tested a grassroots approach

--

**How it worked:**

1. **Household survey** — collected data on experiences with public health facilities

2. **Community meeting** — shared survey results with villagers

3. **Health center meeting** — shared results with health workers

4. **Interface meeting** — community and health workers create joint action plan

5. **Ongoing monitoring** — community members monitor facility performance

---

# Uganda: Study design

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/monitoring.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Design:** Randomized controlled trial comparing communities with vs. without the intervention.

---

# Uganda: Results on process

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/monitoring2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Finding:** Treatment communities became significantly more involved in monitoring health workers.

---

# Uganda: Results on outcomes

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/monitoring3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Findings:** In treatment communities:
- Health workers were more present
- Health utilization improved
- **Health outcomes improved** (including child mortality)

---

# Other supply-side interventions that work

Evidence from NGOs and research shows these interventions are effective:

--

| Intervention | What it does |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Community health workers** | Bring basic services to villages |
| **Small incentives for vaccination** | Increase immunization rates |
| **Subsidized bed nets** | Reduce malaria transmission |
| **Water purification** | Improve sanitation cheaply |
| **Micronutrient supplementation** | Address hidden hunger |
| **School-based deworming** | Treat children at scale |
| **Family planning education** | Preventive care |

---

# Pay-for-performance incentives

**The idea:** Reward health workers based on outcomes, not just showing up.

--

**Example: Rwanda (2005)**

The Ministry of Health introduced bonuses for primary healthcare facilities based on:
- Percentage of children vaccinated
- Percentage of births delivered at the facility
- Appropriate emergency transfers during delivery

--

**Results:** (Gertler and Vermeersch, 2013)
- 38% average increase in staff compensation
- **20% increase in service provision**
- Significant improvements in child health

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Incentives can work** — but they need to be well-designed and monitored.

# Demand-Side Determinants

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Why don't people seek health care?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Demand-side barriers to health

Even when services exist, people may not use them due to:

--

| Barrier | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Poverty** | Can't afford transport to clinic |
| **Price sensitivity** | Small fees deter use |
| **Credit constraints** | Can't pay now, even if it saves money later |
| **Information gaps** | Don't know benefits of prevention |
| **Externalities** | Don't consider benefits to others |

---

# Demand is very sensitive to price

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/impact-price-take-and-use-preventive-health-products"&gt;J-PAL Policy Insight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

**Key finding:** Purchase rates of preventive health products **drop off quickly** as prices increase — even small prices dramatically reduce uptake.

---

# Information campaigns alone aren't enough

**Common assumption:** If people knew the benefits of health products, they would buy them.

--

**Evidence:** Information campaigns about bed nets, water treatment, etc. do increase knowledge — but have limited effect on behavior when prices are positive.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Knowing something is good for you isn't enough** if you can't afford it or face other barriers.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Policy implication:** Subsidies or free provision may be necessary for preventive health products.

---

# Case study: Deworming in Kenya

**The problem:** Helminth infections (intestinal worms) are widespread in developing countries.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/children.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;Children requiring preventive treatment for soil-transmitted helminths (2022)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why deworming matters

**Private benefits:**
- Chronic infection weakens immune system
- Causes lethargy and low productivity
- Poor school performance

--

**Social benefits (externalities):**
- Worms spread through feces and contaminated water
- When many people are dewormed, overall infection rates fall
- Benefits even those who weren't treated

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Deworming has large positive externalities** — treating one child helps protect others.
]

---

# Kenya deworming study

**Study:** Miguel and Kremer (2004)

**Design:** Randomized at the school level

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/worm1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- **1998:** Group 1 receives free deworming; Groups 2 &amp; 3 are controls
- **1999:** Groups 1 &amp; 2 receive deworming; Group 3 is control

---

# Kenya: Results

**Direct effects on treated children:**
- Significant reduction in moderate-heavy helminth infection
- Significant reduction in schistosomiasis infection
- Improved health and school attendance

--

**Spillover effects (externalities):**

| Group | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Untreated children in **treatment schools** | Also saw health improvements |
| Children in **nearby control schools** | Also saw some health improvements |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**The externalities are substantial** — deworming benefits spread beyond those directly treated.
]

---

# Should health products be free?

**Concerns about subsidies/free provision:**

--

| Concern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| "People won't value free things" | Studies show bed nets are used similarly whether free or purchased |
| "Price anchoring" — people won't pay later | Dupas (2010): Short-term subsidies don't reduce long-term demand |
| "Overuse leads to drug resistance" | Cohen et al. (2015): Poor diagnostics, not subsidies, drive overuse |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Evidence supports subsidies and free provision** for preventive health products — concerns about misuse are largely unfounded.
]

---

# Main takeaways

**Health is complex** — it encompasses physical, mental, and social wellbeing, requiring multiple indicators to measure.

--

**Health services are under-provided** due to externalities and public good characteristics that cause market failures.

--

**Supply-side challenges** include absenteeism, lack of accountability, and difficulty reaching the poor (as shown in Udaipur).

--

**Supply-side solutions** that work include community monitoring, pay-for-performance incentives, and direct service provision.

--

**Demand-side barriers** include poverty, price sensitivity, credit constraints, and information gaps.

--

**Demand for preventive health is very price-sensitive** — even small fees dramatically reduce uptake.

--

**Subsidies and free provision work** — concerns about misuse are not supported by evidence.

--

**Externalities matter** — interventions like deworming benefit not just recipients but entire communities.

---

# Discussion questions

1. Why do you think people in Udaipur preferred unqualified private doctors over free public clinics?

--

2. Should preventive health products (bed nets, deworming pills) be provided for free, or should there be a small charge? What are the trade-offs?

--

3. How might community monitoring work differently in different cultural contexts?
