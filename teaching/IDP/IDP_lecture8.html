  What is health?
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# What is health?

Health is a form of human capital that is complex because it is multidimensional and full of unknowns. 

--

The definition of good health is itself controversial. 

--

The World Health Organization (2015) defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity."

--

Thus, multiple indicators are needed to characterize health status of a population, and they are difficult to measure with accuracy.


---

class: inverse 

This week, we will explore the crucial topic of health, focusing on three key areas:

--

Health Indicators

- What are the key metrics used to measure health outcomes?


--

Determinants of Health Outcomes:

- What factors influence health outcomes?

--

Effective Policy Interventions:

- What does empirical evidence tell us about programs that successfully improve health outcomes?

&lt;div style="font-size: 26px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Health indicators
&lt;/div&gt; 

---

# Life expectancy at birth

Life expectancy at birth is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming that current mortality rates remain unchanged throughout their life.

--

This is the most commonly used indicator of the overall health status of a population.

--

But, it falls short of the WTO definition of health as it does not measure the level of wellbeing achieved during these years.

--

Life expectancy at birth has been increasing across the world

- yet there are wide differences across regions and countries.


---

# Life expectancy at birth

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography?tab=map&amp;time=1978&amp;overlay=embed&amp;hideControls=true&amp;indicator=Life+expectancy&amp;Sex=Both+sexes&amp;Age=Under+1+year&amp;Projection+scenario=High&amp;country=CHN~IND~USA~IDN~PAK~NGA~BRA~JPN" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 550px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


---

# Health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE)

HALE is equal to the ideal life expectancy minus the years lost due to premature death and disability. 

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/healthy-life-expectancy-at-birth?time=latest&amp;overlay=embed&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


---

# Infant mortality rate

Infant mortality rate tells us the share of newborns who die before they are one year old.

--

This is a good indicator of health status as it characterizes the population most at risk of ill health. 

- and it is quite responsive to changes in health conditions.

--

Infant mortality rate has decreased across the world.

--

Yet, there are wide differences across regions and countries.

---

# Burden of disease

This indicator measures years of "good" life lost due to both premature death and disability.

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/dalys-rate-from-all-causes?overlay=embed&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

# Burden of disease

The global decrease is mostly driven by decrease in burden of disease for young children.

&lt;/div&gt;



---

# Hunger and malnutrition

We use several indicators to measure malnutrition:

--

**(Average) daily calorie intake**: based on consumption from memory or diaries.

--

**Micro-nutrient deficiencies**: established by blood test to measure deficiencies in iron, zinc, vitamin A. Hard to diagnose, referred to as hidden hunger.

--

**Anthopometrics measures**: z-scores for stunting (height-for-age ratio: long-term health that reflects early malnutrition) and wasting (weight-for-height ratio: current nutritional status).

--

**Body-mass index (BMI)**: ratio of weight (kilograms) to the square of height (meters).

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Supply-side determinants of health achievements
&lt;/div&gt; 


---



# Supply-side determinants

The supply side determinants are linked to public goods and policy.

--

There is a tendency for under-provision of health services due to their public-goods nature and large positive externalities, making market fail.

--

**Positive externalities**:

- Health benefits not only individuals but also society by reducing disease spread, improving workforce productivity, and enhancing overall well-being.
- These spillover benefits are not fully captured by private returns, which reduces the incentive for individuals and private markets to invest sufficiently in health.

--

**Public good characteristics**:

- Health services often have public good features, such as disease control and herd immunity, which are non-exclusive and partially non-rivalrous. 
  
--

**Market failures and equity concerns**:
  
- Private providers may not recover full costs/serve poorer populations adequately, leading to gaps in quality &amp; access.





---

# Supply-side determinants

The supply side determinants are linked to public goods and policy.

These issues are **exacerbated in poor countries**:

- **weak fiscal resources** and **low availability and quality of medical personnel**. 

--

The main healthcare supply problems in developing countries are: 

--

  - the difficulty of inducing qualified doctors and health personnel to work in public clinics and health centers
  
--

  - the difficulty of targeting the poor for the free delivery of health services

--

Let us discuss a case study on health care delivery in rural Rajasthan, India. 

- Although the data are somewhat dated, the lessons remain relevant today.


---

# The health care delivery in Rural Rajasthan

Motivation: there is **little information about the delivery of health care in rural India**, and about **the relationship (if any) between health care and health status**.

--

Abhijit Banerjee, Angus Deaton, and Esther Duflo collaborated with Seva Mandir, a local NGO active for over 50 years in Udaipur, Rajasthan. 

--

They conducted **a year-long survey of health status, health services, and health behavior**.

--

The survey took place between January 2002 and August 2003 in Udaipur district, which is one of the poorest districts in India, with a **large tribal population and an unusually high level of female illiteracy**.

  - 100 villages
  
  - approximately 1000 households
  
  - 451 modern, private facilities
  
  - 123 public facilities, visited every week
  
---

# The Udaipur health and wellbeing survey 

We will discuss the results along three main aspects:

  - Health status
  
  - Patterns of demand for health care
  
  - Patterns of supply of health care
  
  
---

# Health status is poor

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- Height and weight: 88% of women, 93% of men have BMI below 21 (average = 18)

--

- Respiratory problems: peak flow meter on average 316 ml per expiration 

  - (anything below 350 is symptoms of respiratory difficulties)

--

- Anemia: 56% of women and 51% of men are anemic 



---

# People rare visit public health facility 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- On average, household visits are once every two months.
- Most health visits are to private health facilities.
- No one uses public facilities very much, and if anything, the poor use them less than the non-poor.

---

# High share of health expenses

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


High share of budget is devoted to health, even by the poor.


---

class: inverse 


Why then do we see people not making use of the public health system and relying on private health care?

--

In part, the answer must lie in the way the public system actually works.

--

The public health care sector is a 3-tiered system:

--

- One sub-center for 3000 people, close (within 2 km in Udaipur), a nurse provides preventive care and referral, free treatment

--

- One primary health center for 50,000 people, and 

--

- Community health centers and district hospitals for bad cases.

--

On paper, this is an ideal system of public health facilities for a developing country.

--

But what are the realities?


---

# High absenteeism

High absenteeism of medical personnel in public facility

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health5.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Private sector completely unregulated

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/health4.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The private sector is completely unregulated with terrible quality


---

# The interactions between supply and demand 

People are less likely to use public facilities when nurses are often absent or when a facility is closed.

--

There are two possible explanations for this:

--

- Patients are discouraged by high absence rate of medical personnel.

--

- Nurses are discouraged by the low medical demand.

--

These two phenomena can be present simultaneously.


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# 

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Can we fix this public health care problem?
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# The case of Uganda

Uganda face a similar problem: absence rate in health center was 47% in 2004.

--

Björkman and Svensson (2009) proposed to address this issue through a **grassroots approach by involving the community in monitoring healthcare providers**.

--

The intervention started with a household survey to collect data on experience with public health facilities.

--

Then community organizations facilitated 3 meetings: a community meeting, a meeting at the health center, and an interface meeting.

--

- These meetings aim to result in an action plan on how to improve the situation, and how the community members would monitor the facilities.


---

# Community-level monitoring in Uganda

Bjorkman and Svensson (2009) assessed the effectiveness of this intervention through an RCT.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/monitoring.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/monitoring3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 750px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Community-level monitoring in Uganda

To summarize, compared to communities where the intervention did not happen:

--

- Treatment community became more involved in monitoring health workers. 

--

- In treatment community:

  - health workers were more present. 

  - health utilization improved in some respects. 
  
  - health outcomes improved.

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  What are other supply-side health policies to improve health achievements?
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Health services provision

Many NGOs and research universities have found these to be effective

--

- provision of basic health services through community health workers

--

- small incentives for the vaccination of children

--

- subsidies to the acquisition of bed nets

--

- improved sanitation through cheap water-purification methods

--

- supplementation of normal household diets with micronutrients

--

- de-worming of school children

--

- preventive care with services such as family-planning education and use of condoms

--

- focusing on delivery to reduce, through barefoot supervision, the misuse of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and antiretroviral AIDS medicine


---

# Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on pharmaceuticals

Policy options include market segmentation and differential pharmaceutical pricing between MDC and LDC markets for shared diseases.

  - Encourage pharmaceutical companies to donate drug licenses to LDCs for generic production.

  - Introduce IPR protection in LDCs for tropical and low-income-specific diseases to attract private research.

--

Research on LDC diseases can be promoted by:

  - Competitive research grants (e.g., Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for malaria vaccine development).

  - Donor-funded guaranteed purchase programs or innovation prizes to ensure a market for new drugs in developing countries (Kremer, 2002; Stiglitz &amp; Jayadev, 2010).

  - Public research on “orphan diseases” with markets too small for private investment.
  
---

# Pay for performance incentives

The objective is to introduce incentives where providers are rewarded for performance. 

--

In 2005, the Ministry of Health in Rwanda introduced a scheme of payments for performance (P4P), awarding bonuses to primary-healthcare facilities based on the provision of various types of service and their quality

  - percentage of children vaccinated, 
  
  - the percentage of birth deliveries in the facility, and
  
  - the incidence of appropriate emergency transfers to hospital during delivery. 

--

On average, there was a 38% increase in staff compensation.

--

Gertler and Vermeersch (2013) find that the incentives led to a 20% increase in the provision of services and to significant improvements in child health.

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Demand-side determinants of health achievements
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Demand-side determinants of health achievements

There are different demand-side determinants of health outcomes

  - Income effects (e.g., poverty)
  
  - Price effects
  
  - Externalities and coordination
  
  - Credit constraints
  
  - Information asymmetries


---

# Preventive health products

The demand for preventive health products is very sensitive to price.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/impact-price-take-and-use-preventive-health-products"&gt;https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/impact-price-take-and-use-preventive-health-products&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Preventive health products

Purchase rates of preventive health products drop off quickly as prices increase.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/demand.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/impact-price-take-and-use-preventive-health-products"&gt;https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/impact-price-take-and-use-preventive-health-products&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

class: inverse

Research has also shown that information campaigns about the benefits of health products are not enough to mitigate the drop-off in demand with price.

--

So, what can we do as a policymaker to improve health outcomes?

--

Let us examine a case study on infectious diseases.





---

# Case study: Infectious diseases

Helminth infections are widespread.
  
  - Hookworms, pinworms, whipworms, schistosomiasis.
  
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  Number of children requiring preventive chemotherapy for soil-transmitted helminthiases in 2022 &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/children.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Schistosomiasis

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/schistosomiasis2.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoo9T3emHIQ"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoo9T3emHIQ&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Private and social benefits of deworming

Deworming has large private benefits: improved health.

--

- Chronic infection can lead to weaker immune system, which increases danger of other infections, lethargy, resulting in low productivity and poor performance.

--

- Deworming also has large positive externalities.

--

- Many worms spread through feces and water.

--

- When large number of people are dewormed, overall infection rates migh decrease, benefiting even those who have not been treated.
    
---

# Deworming program in Western Kenya

Miguel and Kremer (2004) conducted a randomization at the school level, providing free deworming to students. 

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/worm1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- In 1998: G1 treatment, G2 and G3 control

- In 1999: G1 and G2 treatment, G3 control

---

# Deworming program in Western Kenya

There are significant improvements in the health outcomes 

--

- Reduction in moderate-heavy helminth infection

--

- Reduction in moderate-heavy schistosomiasis infection

--

- Reduction in moderate-heavy geohelminth infection

--
  
These effects are documented not only among children who received the free deworming, 

--

- but also other children in the same treatment schools who did not receive the free deworming (within-school externalities)

--

- and other children in control schools nearby who did not receive free deworming (cross-school externalities)

---

# Price subsidies and free provision

There are some arguments against price subsidies and free provision.

--

Subsidies for health products may lead to concerns about misuse, underuse, or resistance to market prices:

--

- yet studies show essential items like water filters and bed nets still see significant use in countries like Kenya and Ghana.

--

The "price anchoring" argument suggests people may resist paying full price after receiving subsidized goods:

--

- but a study by Dupas (2010) found that short-term subsidies didn’t reduce long-term demand.

--

Another fear is that subsidies lead to overuse of treatments like malaria drugs, promoting resistance: 

--

- yet research by Cohen et al. (2015) links this more to poor diagnostics than to subsidies.

# Main Takeaways

- Health is a complex form of human capital, encompassing physical, mental, and social well-being.

--

- Measuring health requires multiple complementary indicators.

--

- Health services are often under-provided due to positive externalities (e.g., disease control) and public good characteristics that lead to market failures.

--

- Supply-side challenges include underfunding, absenteeism, lack of personnel, and issues in public versus private sector delivery (illustrated by cases like Udaipur, India).

--

- Demand-side barriers include poverty, price sensitivity, credit constraints, and information asymmetries.

--

- Rigorous evaluations show that community monitoring, performance-based incentives, and targeted interventions (e.g., vaccinations, bed nets, deworming) can improve health outcomes.

--

- Price subsidies and free provision generally increase uptake of preventive health products without causing long-term market distortions.

--

- Effective health policies require addressing both supply and demand factors while leveraging evidence-based approaches.
