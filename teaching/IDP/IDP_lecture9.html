For much of the world’s population—especially the poor—labor is their principal, and often only, asset.

--

In developing countries, most people derive their livelihoods from work: 

--

- wage employment,

--
self-employment, 

--
other informal activities.

--

Incomes are low, uncertain, and earnings inequality is shaped by labor market dynamics.

--

To understand development, we must examine how labor markets function: 

--

- who gets work,

--
at what wages,

--
under what conditions

--

- and how mobility and migration open (or close) opportunities.

--

This week, we will deep dive into labor markets—their structure, challenges, and the vital role of labor movement—both within and across countries.

  Indicator of employment

---

# Some employment indicators 

- Employed: Anyone working any kind of job—formal or informal.

--

- Unemployed: Want to work and actively searching but can’t find a job.

--

- Hidden unemployment: People who want to work but gave up looking.

--

- Underemployment: Working less than they want or in low-paying jobs.

--

Imagine a young person who lost their job last month and is looking for work—that’s unemployment.


---

class: inverse 

Below are statistics showing unemployment rates across different countries and demographic groups.

--

In your groups, please discuss:

- What key trends or patterns do you notice in these unemployment rates?

- What do you think might explain the differences across countries, genders, or other groups?

# Observations and discussions 

--

Observation 1: **Less developed countries do not always have higher unemployment rates.**

--

- Lack of social safety nets: many people cannot afford to be unemployed, relying on informal/low-paying jobs.
  
- Underemployment vs. Unemployment: LDCs often have more underemployment (people working fewer hours than they want or in low-productivity jobs) rather than outright unemployment.

--

Observation 2: **People with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed**

--

- Discrimination and bias result in unfair hiring practices for qualified applicants with disabilities

- Lack of accessibility, limited education and training opportunities for people with disabilities


--

Observation 3: **Unemployment rates often vary significantly between genders** 

--

- Labor market discrimination, workplace policies and maternity leave, educational and occupational segregation

- Social and cultural barriers: traditional gender roles, family responsibilities, and restrictions on women's workforce participation

  Labor markets in developing countries
&lt;/div&gt;

# Labor markets in developing countries

The **share of wage employment is low**, and the overwhelming majority of days worked are in self-employment. 

- The wage employment rate typically ranges from 10% to 15% in rural areas; even in urban areas, it is only
25–50% across most countries in this sample.

&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Labor markets in developing countries

Donovan et al. (2024) shows that **the higher labor market flows in developing countries are mostly driven by transitions into and out of marginal jobs**:

--

  - self-employment, low-earnings wage jobs 
  
--

There is **no difference from developed countries in terms of labor flows to formal, above-median earnings wage work**.

# Labor markets in developing countries

To summarize the main features of labor markets in developing countries:

--

- Standard labor market flows are all higher compared to developed countries

  - But this is mostly driven by difference in labor flows into marginal employment (self-employment, low-earning wage work) 
  
  - No difference in terms of labor flows to formal, above-median earnings wage work
  
--

- Evidence of slippery job ladder 

  - Workers cannot move to better/higher earning wage work
  
--

- Self-employment is closer substitute to unemployment

We have come across the term **informal employment**.

--
But what does it exactly mean?

--

And how is informal employment related to formal employment?

  Informal and formal employment 
&lt;/div&gt; 
  
  
---

# Informality 

From the **employee perspective**:

--

- Informal employment means having **a job without formal contracts, legal protections, or social benefits** like health insurance, paid leave, or retirement plans.

--

- This includes self-employment in small, unregistered businesses, casual or seasonal wage work, and family or home-based work without official recognition.

--

- Informal workers often face job insecurity, low and irregular incomes, and limited access to rights and protections.

--

From the **employer perspective**:

--

- Informal employers run **small-scale businesses that are not officially registered or regulated**.

--

- They may avoid taxes, labor laws, or licensing requirements to reduce costs and survive in competitive or constrained environments.

--

- For some, informality is a survival strategy due to barriers in accessing formal markets, while others may choose informality for flexibility and independence.

---

# Informal (non-agricultural) employment

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/informal-employment-of-total-non-agricultural-employment?time=2017&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

# Informality remains a key concern for development

Informality remains a key concern of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

- In 2023, over 2 billion workers globally were employed informally, accounting for 58.0% of the global workforce. 
- Informality rate declines by less than 1 %p since 2015, far too slow. 

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


---

# Informal and formal employment

There is a close relationship between the formal and informal sectors.

--

- High regulation in the formal sector can push labor into the informal sector.
  
--

- High wages in the formal sector (above equilibrium) also drive labor to the informal economy.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/formal_informal.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
---

# Informal and formal wages

Why wages in the formal sector are generally higher than the informal sector?

--

**High unionization**:

  - Collective bargaining power: Unions negotiate for higher wages, better working conditions, benefits.

  - Wage floors: Unions often push for minimum wage standards that employers must follow.

  - Job security: Strong labor protections in unionized jobs lead to more stable, well-paid employment.

--

**Government regulation**:

  - Minimum wage laws: Many formal sector jobs are subject to government-imposed wage floors.

  - Worker protections: Regulations mandate overtime pay, sick leave, social benefits (health/unemployment insurance, pension) and other compensation, increasing overall wages.

  - Compliance costs: Formal employers must adhere to taxation and labor laws, which often result in higher wages to attract and retain workers.

---

# Efficiency wages theory

This theory posits that **employers pay wages above the market equilibrium to incentivize higher effort and productivity**.

--

What could be the rationale behind this?

--

- Attract more skilled workers.

--

- Reduce turnover, as employees are less likely to leave for other opportunities.
  
--

- Increase motivation, as workers are more likely to put in extra effort if compensated well.
  
--

- Increase nutrition, thus physical health, cognitive function, and labor productivity.

---

# Informality 

Informal employment can be either:

--

- **Pro-cyclical**: informal employment **expands during economic booms **

  - when increased formal employment boosts demand for goods and services from the informal sector.

--

- **Counter-cyclical**: informal employment **expands during economic downturns** 

  - as workers unable to find formal jobs seek employment in the informal sector.

--

The relationship between formal and informal employment depends on economic conditions and labor market dynamics.



---

class: inverse

In many developing countries, stable, formal wage jobs are scarce 

- and many workers operate in informal, unstable employment.

--

To improve livelihoods, households often rely on labor mobility:

- moving within the country or internationally in search of better work.

--

Migration is not just a response to economic necessity 

- but also influenced by social networks, policies, and labor market conditions.

--

Next, we will explore the theories, patterns, and consequences of labor migration.

&lt;div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"&gt;
  Migration
&lt;/div&gt; 


---

# Rural-Urban Migration

The decision to migrate is driven by the wage disparity between urban and rural labor markets. 

--

Migration helps equilibrate the labor market by shifting workers toward higher-productivity urban jobs. 

--

In this context, migration is both a natural and beneficial process, fostering efficiency gains and contributing to poverty reduction.


---

# Individual decision to migrate: Harris–Todaro model 

Consider an individual deciding whether to remain in the rural sector or migrate to the urban sector.

--

- If she stays in the rural sector, she can earn a wage `\(w_a\)` (e.g., working in agriculture).
  
--

- If she migrates to the urban sector, she has the potential to earn a higher wage `\(\bar{w}_m\)` by working in the modern sector.

--

- However, this outcome is uncertain, as there is a risk of unemployment if she is unable to secure a job.
    
--

- Let `\(p\)` be the probability of getting a job in the urban sector.
  
--

An individual migrates if expected urban wage is higher than the rural (agricultural) wage:

`$$w_m^* = w_m = p*\bar{w}_m+(1-p)* 0 &gt; w_a$$` 

---

# What are policy implications of this model? 

How should developing countries react to the spread of urban slums?

--

Create new jobs in the formal sector? 

--
Not the right solution.

--

- The policy can increase both the number of migrants and the number of unemployed.
  
--

Reduce the gap between urban and rural wages?

--

- Lower urban wage: e.g., resist excessive union power when there is too much unemployment.

--

- Push rural wage: e.g., rural development programs, land reform, better technology and institutions 

  - goal is to improve productivity in agriculture, and decentralize employment toward rural areas in order to create a thriving rural non-farm economy.


---

# The new migration economics

Migration decisions are made at the household level, not just by the individual.

--


- Sending a family member to migrate provides potential remittances as a key benefit.

--

The household invests in migration costs and absorbs the risks, expecting remittances in return.

--

- From this perspective, sending a migrant is a first-best decision for maximizing household income.

---


# Migration costs and constraints

Migration can be costly: 

- travel expenses are high, 

- migrants often depend on intermediaries who charge high fees for arranging visas and work permits. 

--

In some cases, migrants pay guides to help them cross borders illegally. 

--

For poor migrants who cannot borrow against future earnings, these costs can be prohibitive. 

--

Additionally, the risk of urban unemployment can deter migration, 

- especially if migrants lack financial resources or access to credit.

--

The poorest individuals—who have the greatest incentive to migrate—often migrate less than those who are better off.

--

So, how can we encourage those poor individuals/households to migrate?


---

# Case study: Seasonal hunger and migration

Three hundred million of the world’s rural poor suffer from seasonal income insecurity,

- which often occurs between planting and harvest when the demand for agricultural labor falls and the price of food rises. 

--


**Those who undergo a lean season typically miss meals for a two- to three-month period.** 

--


This is **especially problematic for pregnant women and young children** 

- since poor nutrition for even a short time can limit long-term cognitive and physical development. 

--

Seasonal hunger and deprivation is perhaps the biggest challenge to the reduction of global poverty that has remained largely under the radar.

---

# Case study: Seasonal hunger and migration

Bryan et al. (2014) conducted an **RCT in Northern Bangladesh to study seasonal migration in Bangladesh**.

--

- Control households: no intervention, status quo

--

- Treatment households: an $8.50 cash grant during the pre-harvest "hungry season" 

  - to cover *round-trip travel costs* (e.g., bus ticket), creating an incentive for rural inhabitants to migrate. 

--

They found that the grant led to **22% of households sending a seasonal migrant**.

--

- Families with migration incentives experienced **higher caloric intake** compared to those without.

--

- Many households chose to **re-migrate** the following year **without additional incentives**.


---

class: inverse 

People don’t just move within their own country, for example from rural to urban areas. 

--

Many also migrate across countries, seeking better opportunities and different livelihoods.

--

Now, we will explore the general patterns of international migration, 

- and dive into the ongoing debate about its impacts, including the ideas of **brain gain** versus **brain drain**.

What are the impacts of international migration?

--

In groups of 4-6 students, you will discuss the paper "Brain drain or brain gain? Effects of high-skilled international emigration on origin countries" by Batista et al. (2025, Science).

--

Group Assignments:

- 2 groups: Conceptual framework and definitions of brain drain/gain

- 2 groups: Mechanisms via which migration affects origin countries (skills, remittances, knowledge, return migration)

- 2 groups: Empirical evidence and causal methods used in the paper

- 2 groups: Policy implications and recommendations

- 2 groups: Social, political, and welfare impacts on origin communities

---

class: inverse 

Process: 

- Spend 20-30 minutes discussing your assigned topics in your group.

- Prepare a 2-3-minute presentation summarizing your main points.

- Present to the class and listen to the complementary group assigned to the same topic.

- Open floor for class discussion based on presentations and questions.


---

# The brain drain/brain gain debate

**Conceptual Understanding**:

- How does the paper define "brain drain" and "brain gain"? What are the key mechanisms that differentiate these outcomes?

- How does the "brain circulation" concept add nuance to the traditional brain drain debate?

**Mechanisms and Channels**:

- How can migration opportunities incentivize skill acquisition in origin countries? Are there conditions under which this incentive might not work well?

- Discuss the roles of remittances, knowledge transfers, diaspora networks, and return migration in influencing origin-country development outcomes.

---

# The brain drain/brain gain debate

**Empirical Evidence &amp; Methods**: 

- What types of empirical methods do the authors highlight as especially important for rigorously identifying causal effects of skilled emigration? Why are these methods necessary in this context? 

- Discuss the evidence from the Philippines and India on how visa policy changes affected domestic skill acquisition. What are some potential limitations or alternative explanations?


**Policy Implications**:

- According to the paper, why might policies that restrict skilled migration be misguided? What kinds of origin-country policies could better harness the benefits of migration?

- How important are higher education systems and the domestic labor market’s capacity in shaping whether migration results in brain gain or brain drain?


---

# The brain drain/brain gain debate

**Wider Socio-Political Effects**:

- What evidence does the paper give regarding migration’s influence on political attitudes, governance, and social norms back home? What mechanisms might explain these effects?

**Application to your context**:

- Can you think of any potential unintended consequences of encouraging high-skilled emigration or policies designed to support "brain gain"?

- How might the insights from this paper apply differently to your own country or region of interest?


---

# Main takeaways 

High-skilled emigration from developing countries has long raised brain drain concerns (loss of human capital).

--

New evidence shows migration often induces “brain gain” by incentivizing education, expanding skilled labor supply beyond emigrants, and fostering return migration.

--

Benefits flow through multiple channels:

--

- Remittances financing education and investment

- Knowledge, technology, and norm transfers via diaspora and returnees

- Expanded trade, FDI, entrepreneurship, and innovation at origin

--

Welfare impacts: Migrants earn much higher incomes; origin households and regions gain through economic development and improved health and political norms.

--

Net effects depend on: origin country’s education capacity, labor market, skill types emigrating, and policy environment.

--

Policy implication: Restricting emigration is counterproductive; instead, policies should support flexible education, diaspora engagement, return migration, and skill investment to maximize “brain gain.”
