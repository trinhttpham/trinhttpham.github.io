# Opening question

A factory worker in India earns **$5 per day**.

The same worker, doing the same job in the United States, earns **$80 per day**.

&lt;br&gt;

Today we'll explore:
- How labor markets work differently in developing countries
- Why informal employment dominates
- How migration decisions are made — and what policies can help

# Session 1

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Labor Markets in Developing Countries
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why labor markets matter for development

For most of the world's population — especially the poor — **labor is their principal asset**.

--

In developing countries, people derive their livelihoods from:
- Wage employment
- Self-employment
- Informal activities

--

&lt;br&gt;

To understand poverty and development, we must understand:
- Who gets work?
- At what wages?
- Under what conditions?

---

# Employment Indicators

---

# Key employment concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Employed** | Working any job — formal or informal |
| **Unemployed** | Want to work, actively searching, but can't find a job |
| **Hidden unemployment** | Want to work but gave up looking |
| **Underemployment** | Working less than desired, or in jobs below skill level |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Example:** A young person who lost their job last month and is actively looking for work → **unemployed**

**Example:** A trained accountant working part-time as a street vendor → **underemployed**

---

# Group discussion

Below are statistics showing unemployment rates across different countries and demographic groups.

--

In your groups, please discuss:

1. What key trends or patterns do you notice?

2. What might explain the differences across countries, genders, or other groups?

---

---

# Discussion: Key observations

**Observation 1: Less developed countries don't always have higher unemployment**

--

- Why? Many people **cannot afford to be unemployed** — no safety nets
- They take any work available, even low-paying informal jobs
- **Underemployment** is more common than unemployment in LDCs

--

**Observation 2: People with disabilities face higher unemployment**

--

- Discrimination in hiring
- Lack of workplace accessibility
- Limited education and training opportunities

--

**Observation 3: Gender gaps vary significantly**

--

- Labor market discrimination
- Traditional gender roles and family responsibilities
- Educational and occupational segregation

# Labor Markets in Developing Countries

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
What makes them different?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Feature 1: Low share of wage employment

Most work in developing countries is **self-employment**, not wage work.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/labor1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- Wage employment: only 10-15% in rural areas, 25-50% in urban areas
- The rest is self-employment, family work, or informal activities

---

# Feature 2: Higher labor market flows

Donovan et al. (2024) document that **workers in developing countries change jobs much more frequently**.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/donovan1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Employment exit rates** are higher in poorer countries (lower GDP per capita).

---

# Feature 2: Higher labor market flows

**Job-finding rates** are also higher in developing countries — but mostly for low-quality jobs.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/donovan2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# Feature 2: Higher labor market flows

**Job-to-job transitions** and **occupation switching** are both much higher in developing countries.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/donovan3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



---

# Why are flows higher? It's about job quality

Donovan et al. (2024) show that higher labor market flows in developing countries are **driven by transitions into and out of marginal jobs**:

--

- Self-employment
- Low-earnings wage jobs

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Key finding:** There is NO difference between developed and developing countries in flows to **formal, above-median earnings wage work**.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

The difference is about the **prevalence of bad jobs**, not about labor market dynamism.

---

# Feature 3: Limited job ladder climbing

In developed countries, workers typically progress: unemployment → entry-level job → better job → even better job.

--

In developing countries, evidence of this **"job ladder"** is limited.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/donovan7.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Notes: U = Unemployed, S = Self-employed, N = Inactive, W = Wage worker&lt;/small&gt;

---

# Feature 3: Limited job ladder climbing

In developing countries, evidence of this **"job ladder"** is limited.

Workers in developing countries are **more likely to move sideways or down** than to climb up.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/donovan8.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Notes: Ws = same earnings, Wu = higher earnings, Wd = lower earnings&lt;/small&gt;



---

# Feature 4: Self-employment ≈ Unemployment

In developing countries, **self-employed and unemployed workers look very similar**:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/donovan9.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- They switch to wage work at similar rates
- They earn similar wages after switching

---

# Summary: Labor markets in developing countries

| Feature | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **Low wage employment** | Most people are self-employed or informal |
| **Higher labor flows** | But driven by marginal jobs, not good jobs |
| **Slippery job ladder** | Hard to move up to better-paying work |
| **Self-employment ≈ Unemployment** | Self-employment is often a fallback, not a choice |

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**Bottom line:** The challenge isn't creating "more jobs" — it's creating **good jobs** with stable wages and benefits.

# Informality: Two perspectives

.pull-left[
**From the employee perspective:**

- Jobs without formal contracts
- No legal protections
- No benefits (health insurance, paid leave, pension)
- Includes: casual work, street vending, domestic work
- Often: job insecurity, low/irregular income
]

.pull-right[
**From the employer perspective:**

- Small businesses not officially registered
- May avoid taxes and labor laws
- For some: survival strategy
- For others: flexibility and independence
]

&lt;style&gt;
.pull-left { width: 45%; margin-left: 2.5%; }
.pull-right { width: 45%; margin-right: 2.5%; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

# Informal employment around the world

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/informal-employment-of-total-non-agricultural-employment?time=2017&amp;tab=map" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 0px none;" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Informality remains a major challenge

- In 2023: **over 2 billion workers** globally employed informally (58% of workforce)
- Progress has been slow — less than 1 percentage point decline since 2015

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/informality.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://ilostat.ilo.org/topics/informality/"&gt;ILO Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why are formal wages higher?

Wages in the formal sector are generally higher than in the informal sector. Why?

--

**High unionization:**
- Collective bargaining pushes wages up
- Unions negotiate for benefits and job security

--

**Government regulation:**
- Minimum wage laws
- Mandated benefits (health insurance, pension, paid leave)
- Compliance costs passed on as higher wages

--

**Efficiency wages:**
- Employers pay above-market wages to attract better workers, reduce turnover, and increase motivation

---

# The formal-informal relationship

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/formal_informal.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- High regulation in formal sector → pushes workers to informal sector
- High wages in formal sector → more competition for formal jobs → surplus labor goes informal

---

# Is informality pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical?

Informal employment can be either:

--

**Pro-cyclical** (expands during booms):
- Economic growth increases demand for goods/services
- Formal sector growth spills over to informal suppliers

--

**Counter-cyclical** (expands during downturns):
- Workers laid off from formal jobs seek informal work
- Informal sector absorbs surplus labor

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
The relationship depends on economic conditions and the structure of the labor market.

# Session 1 summary

--

**Labor is the main asset of the poor** — understanding labor markets is essential for development.

--

**Developing country labor markets** feature: low wage employment, high labor flows (mostly to bad jobs), slippery job ladders, and self-employment as a fallback.

--

**Informal employment** dominates in developing countries — over 58% of global workforce.

--

**Formal wages are higher** due to unions, regulations, and efficiency wage considerations.

--

**The challenge:** Creating good jobs, not just any jobs.

# Session 2

&lt;div style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Migration
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why study migration?

In many developing countries:
- Stable, formal wage jobs are scarce
- Many workers are in informal, unstable employment

--

To improve livelihoods, households often rely on **labor mobility**:
- Moving within the country (rural-urban)
- Moving internationally

--

Migration is:
- A response to economic necessity
- Shaped by social networks and policies
- Both a challenge and an opportunity for development

---

# Internal Migration

&lt;div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;
Rural-Urban Migration
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Why do people migrate to cities?

The classic economic answer: **wage gaps**

--

- Urban wages are typically higher than rural wages
- Migration shifts workers toward higher-productivity jobs
- This can reduce poverty and increase efficiency

--

&lt;br&gt;

But if urban wages are higher, **why doesn't everyone migrate?**

---

# The Harris-Todaro Model: A simple example

Consider Maria, a rural worker in Mexico deciding whether to migrate to the city.

--

**If she stays in the village:**
- She earns **$5/day** working on a farm (guaranteed)

--

**If she migrates to the city:**
- She *might* get a factory job paying **$15/day**
- But there's only a **50% chance** of finding that job
- If she doesn't find work, she earns **$0**

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Should Maria migrate?**

---

# The Harris-Todaro Model: The calculation

**Expected urban earnings:**

`$$\text{Expected wage} = (\text{Probability of job}) \times (\text{Urban wage})$$`

$$= 0.50 \times \$15 = \$7.50 \text{ per day}$$

--

**Compare to rural wage:** $5/day

--

**Decision:** $7.50 &gt; $5, so Maria should migrate!

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**The Harris-Todaro insight:** People migrate based on *expected* urban wages, not guaranteed wages. This explains why migration continues even when urban unemployment exists.
]

---

# Policy implications of Harris-Todaro

**Should governments create more urban jobs to reduce slums?**

--

Surprisingly: **Not necessarily!**

--

- Creating more urban jobs raises the probability of finding work
- This attracts MORE migrants
- Could increase both employment AND unemployment

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Better approaches:**

- Raise rural wages (rural development, agricultural technology)
- Reduce the urban-rural wage gap
- Decentralize employment toward rural areas

---

# The new economics of migration

The Harris-Todaro model focuses on **individual** decisions.

--

But migration decisions are often made at the **household** level:

--

- Family invests in sending one member to migrate
- Expects **remittances** in return
- Spreads risk across locations

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Migration as household strategy:** Sending a migrant is like an investment — pay costs now, receive remittance income later.
]

---

# Migration barriers

If migration is beneficial, why don't more poor people migrate?

--

**Migration is costly:**
- Travel expenses
- Fees to intermediaries (visas, work permits)
- Risk of failure (no job, deportation)

--

**The poorest face the biggest barriers:**
- Cannot borrow against future earnings
- Cannot afford upfront costs
- Cannot absorb the risk of failure

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-yellow[
**Paradox:** Those with the most to gain from migration often migrate the least.
]

---

# Case study: Seasonal hunger in Bangladesh

**The problem:** 300 million rural poor worldwide suffer from **seasonal income insecurity**.

--

- Between planting and harvest, agricultural labor demand falls
- Food prices rise
- Families go hungry for 2-3 months

--

**This is devastating for:**
- Pregnant women
- Young children (cognitive and physical development)

--

&lt;br&gt;

Could migration help? Many rural areas have seasonal hunger while nearby cities have jobs.

---

# The Bangladesh migration experiment

**Study:** [Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak (2014)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA10489?msockid=279c202ed2da6a530ea936ded3cd6ba4)

--

**Design:** RCT in Northern Bangladesh during the "hungry season"

| Group | Intervention |
|-------|--------------|
| **Control** | No intervention |
| **Treatment** | $8.50 cash grant to cover round-trip bus fare |

--

&lt;br&gt;

**The idea:** Remove the financial barrier to seasonal migration.

---

# Results: Migration incentives work

**Key findings:**

--

- The $8.50 grant led to **22% of households sending a seasonal migrant**

--

- Families with migrants experienced **higher caloric intake**

--

- Many households chose to **re-migrate the following year without additional incentives**

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-green[
**A small nudge can have lasting effects** — once families learn migration works, they continue on their own.

# The brain drain debate

**Traditional concern:** When skilled workers emigrate, origin countries lose human capital.

--

**"Brain drain":**
- Doctors, engineers, scientists leave
- Countries that invested in their education lose the returns
- Public services suffer (fewer doctors, teachers)

--

&lt;br&gt;

**But is this the whole story?**

---

# Brain drain vs. brain gain

**New evidence suggests migration can also cause "brain gain":**

--

**Incentive effects:**
- Possibility of emigrating increases returns to education
- More people invest in skills (even if not all leave)

--

**Remittances:**
- Migrants send money home
- Families invest in education, health, businesses

--

**Knowledge transfer:**
- Diaspora networks share knowledge
- Return migrants bring back skills and ideas

---

# Group activity: Batista et al. (2025)

In groups, discuss the paper ["Brain drain or brain gain?"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr8861)

--

- **Conceptual:** How does "brain circulation" add nuance to the brain drain debate?

- **Mechanisms:** How can migration opportunities incentivize skill acquisition at home?

- **Evidence:** What methods identify causal effects of skilled emigration?

- **Policy:** Why might restricting skilled migration be counterproductive?

- **Broader impacts:** How does migration affect political attitudes and governance back home?

--

**Process:**
- 20-30 minutes discussion
- 2-3 minute presentation per group
- Class discussion

---

# Batista et al. (2025): Key findings

**Question:** Does high-skilled emigration cause "brain drain" or "brain gain"?

--

**Main findings:**

- Migration often **induces education investment** at home — more people get skills, even if not all leave

--

- Benefits flow through multiple channels:
  - Remittances financing education and investment
  - Knowledge and technology transfer via diaspora
  - Return migrants bring back skills and networks

--

- **Net effects depend on:** origin country's education capacity, labor market conditions, and policy environment

--

**Policy implication:** Restricting emigration is counterproductive — better to invest in education, engage diaspora, and support return migration.


---

# Main takeaways

**Labor markets in developing countries** feature low wage employment, high churning through marginal jobs, and limited upward mobility.

--

**Informal employment** dominates — over half the global workforce lacks formal protections.

--

**Migration decisions** balance expected wages against costs and risks (Harris-Todaro).

--

**Migration barriers** prevent the poorest from moving — small subsidies can help (Bangladesh study).

--

**Brain drain concerns** are real, but migration can also generate "brain gain" through incentives, remittances, and knowledge transfer.

--

**Policy implications:** 
- Create good jobs, not just any jobs
- Reduce migration barriers for the poor
- Engage diaspora networks rather than restricting emigration
